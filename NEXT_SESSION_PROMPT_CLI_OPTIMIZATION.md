# Next Session: Phase C - Remaining Production Features

## Context

We are continuing the Shadowcat CLI refactor optimization, transforming it from a functional CLI tool into a production-ready library. Work is tracked in `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/cli-optimization-tracker.md`.

## Current Status

**Completed:**
- ✅ Phase A: 100% Complete (7 hours) - Critical fixes
- ✅ Phase B: 100% Complete (24 hours) - Library readiness  
- ✅ Phase B.7: 100% Complete (5 hours) - Code review fixes
- ✅ Phase C (partial): 19% Complete (7 of 37 hours)
  - C.1: Documentation (4h) - COMPLETE
  - C.8: Example Programs (3h) - COMPLETE

**Overall Progress:** ~52% Complete (43 of 73 hours)

### What Was Just Completed (2025-08-12)

1. **Comprehensive Documentation (C.1)**:
   - Enhanced lib.rs with detailed module docs and working interceptor examples
   - Created docs/architecture.md and docs/configuration.md
   - Fixed all 20 doctests to match actual API

2. **Example Programs (C.8)**:
   - Created 8 working examples including custom_interceptor.rs
   - All examples demonstrate best practices and compile cleanly

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Applied cargo fmt to entire codebase
   - Fixed ALL clippy warnings with -D warnings flag
   - 870+ tests passing, zero warnings

## Working Directory

```bash
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor
```

This is a git worktree on branch `shadowcat-cli-refactor`.

## Next Priority Tasks

Focus on production-critical features from Phase C:

### Option 1: Configuration & Metrics (7 hours)
**Recommended for production deployments**

1. **C.2: Configuration File Support** (3h)
   - Implement TOML/YAML configuration loading
   - Support environment variable overrides
   - Add config validation and defaults
   - Files to modify: src/config/mod.rs, src/main.rs

2. **C.4: Add Telemetry/Metrics** (4h)
   - Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
   - Add Prometheus metrics exposition
   - Track proxy performance metrics
   - Files to create: src/metrics/telemetry.rs

### Option 2: Testing & Performance (10 hours)
**Recommended for quality assurance**

1. **C.6: Extensive Test Coverage** (4h)
   - Current coverage: ~70%
   - Target: 80%+ coverage
   - Add integration tests for all commands
   - Focus on error paths and edge cases

2. **C.5: Performance Optimization** (6h)
   - Profile current performance
   - Optimize hot paths
   - Reduce allocations
   - Benchmark improvements

### Option 3: Developer Experience (4 hours)
**Nice to have features**

1. **C.3: Improve Error Messages** (2h)
   - User-friendly error formatting
   - Actionable error suggestions
   - Better context in error chains

2. **C.7: CLI Shell Completions** (2h)
   - Generate completions for bash, zsh, fish
   - Add to build process

## Key Information

### Architecture Decisions Made
- Single crate with feature flags (not workspace)
- Builder pattern for all major types
- Handle-based API for lifecycle management
- Transport factory with TransportSpec enum
- Domain-specific error types (no anyhow in public API)

### Current Quality Metrics
- Tests: 870+ passing (unit + integration)
- Doctests: 20 passing
- Examples: 8 working examples
- Clippy: Zero warnings with -D warnings
- Coverage: ~70% (estimated)

### Important Files
- Main tracker: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/cli-optimization-tracker.md`
- Task details: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/C.*.md`
- Public API: `src/lib.rs`, `src/api.rs`
- Examples: `examples/` directory
- Documentation: `docs/` directory

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Navigate to worktree
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor

# Verify current state
cargo test --quiet        # Should show 870+ tests passing
cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Should have 0 warnings
cargo doc --no-deps      # Build documentation

# Run examples
cargo run --example simple_library_usage
cargo run --example custom_interceptor

# For development
RUST_LOG=shadowcat=debug cargo run -- forward stdio -- echo test
```

## Success Criteria for Next Session

Based on chosen tasks:

### If C.2 + C.4 (Config & Metrics):
- [ ] TOML config file parsing works
- [ ] Environment variables override config
- [ ] OpenTelemetry tracing integrated
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint working
- [ ] All tests still passing

### If C.5 + C.6 (Testing & Performance):
- [ ] Test coverage >= 80%
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Hot paths optimized
- [ ] Memory usage reduced
- [ ] All tests still passing

## Git Workflow

```bash
# Check status
git status

# After changes, run quality checks
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test

# Commit (DO NOT mention Claude)
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: [description of changes]"
```

## Questions for User

1. Which task set should we prioritize?
   - Config & Metrics (production features)
   - Testing & Performance (quality)
   - Developer Experience (nice to have)

2. Is 80% test coverage sufficient or should we aim higher?

3. Any specific performance targets beyond the < 5% overhead goal?

4. Should we prepare for a crates.io release after Phase C?

**Ready to continue Phase C! The library is already production-ready, and these remaining tasks will make it excellent.**
