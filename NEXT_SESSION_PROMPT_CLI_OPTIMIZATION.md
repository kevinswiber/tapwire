# Next Session: Shadowcat CLI Optimization - Final Sprint

## Context
We're completing the final tasks for the Shadowcat CLI optimization in the **shadowcat-cli-refactor** worktree.

**IMPORTANT**: Work in the `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor` directory, NOT the main shadowcat directory.

**Current Progress: 78% Complete** (57 of 73 hours completed)

## What Was Just Completed (2025-08-12)

### C.5 - Performance Optimization (6 hours) âœ…
- Cleaned up redundant optimization modules (deleted unused code)
- Properly integrated HTTP connection pooling (32 connections/host, HTTP/2)
- Created and applied buffer size constants throughout codebase
- Integrated flamegraph profiling
- Updated documentation to reflect actual implementation

### C.6 - Extensive Test Coverage (6 hours) âœ…
- Added property-based tests with proptest
- Created integration tests for error paths
- Implemented tests for session limits and concurrent operations
- All 870+ tests passing

## Remaining Tasks (10 hours total)

### Priority 1: C.7 - CLI Shell Completions (2 hours)
**Task File**: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/C.7-shell-completions.md`
- Add shell completion generation using clap
- Support bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell
- Add completions command or --generate-completions flag
- Document installation process

### Priority 2: C.9 - Connection Pooling (3 hours) [Consider Skipping]
**Task File**: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/C.9-connection-pooling.md`
- Note: HTTP pooling already done in C.5
- This is for stdio process pooling
- **Consider**: May not be needed - stdio processes are typically one-shot
- Evaluate necessity before implementing

### Priority 3: C.10 - Load Testing (2 hours)
**Task File**: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/C.10-load-testing.md`
- Create load testing scenarios
- Verify < 100MB memory for 1000 sessions
- Verify > 10,000 requests/second
- Use wrk or custom load generator

### Priority 4: C.11 - Release Preparation (2 hours)
**Task File**: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/C.11-release-prep.md`
- Final quality checks
- Create CHANGELOG.md
- Update README with library usage
- Version bumping
- Ensure all examples work

## Commands to Run at Start
```bash
# Switch to the correct worktree
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor

# Verify we're on the right branch
git status

# Run tests to ensure everything is working
cargo test --quiet

# Check clippy (should be clean)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Build release binary for performance testing
cargo build --release
```

## Key Context
- **All tests passing**: 870+ tests, zero failures
- **Zero clippy warnings**: Code is clean
- **Performance optimizations integrated**: HTTP pooling, buffer constants applied
- **Documentation updated**: Performance doc reflects actual implementation

## Decision Points for This Session

1. **C.9 Stdio Pooling**: 
   - HTTP pooling is done
   - Stdio processes are one-shot by nature
   - **Recommendation**: Skip or reduce scope

2. **Load Testing Approach**:
   - Option A: Use `wrk` for HTTP testing
   - Option B: Write custom Rust load generator
   - Option C: Use existing tools like `vegeta`

3. **Version for Release**:
   - Currently at 0.1.0
   - Consider 0.2.0 for the refactored version
   - Or stay at 0.1.x if maintaining compatibility

## Success Criteria for Completion
- [ ] Shell completions working for at least bash and zsh
- [ ] Load tests demonstrate performance targets
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md documents all changes
- [ ] README updated with library usage examples
- [ ] Final `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` pass
- [ ] Version bumped appropriately

## Files to Reference
- **Tracker**: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/cli-optimization-tracker.md`
- **Performance Doc**: `shadowcat-cli-refactor/docs/performance-optimizations.md`
- **Constants**: `src/transport/constants.rs` (new file with buffer sizes)
- **HTTP Client**: `src/transport/http_client.rs` (pooled client implementation)

## Important Notes
1. The refactor has received an "A" grade from comprehensive code review
2. HTTP connection pooling is already complete - don't duplicate
3. Consider celebrating completion - this has been a major refactor! ðŸŽ‰
4. After these tasks, Shadowcat will be production-ready as both CLI and library
