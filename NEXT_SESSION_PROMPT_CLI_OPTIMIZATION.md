# Next Session: Continue Phase B - Library Readiness

## Context
Task B.2 (Graceful Shutdown) has been successfully completed! We now have a comprehensive shutdown system with signal handling, cleanup hooks, and proper resource management. All 679 tests are passing with no clippy warnings.

## Current State
- **Branch**: `shadowcat-cli-refactor` (git worktree at `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor`)
- **Phase A**: ✅ Complete (CLI module hidden, exit() removed, config centralized)
- **Phase B.1**: ✅ Complete (Builder patterns implemented, all tests passing)
- **Phase B.2**: ✅ Complete (Graceful shutdown with full test coverage)
- **Planning**: Full tracker at `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/cli-optimization-tracker.md`

## What Was Accomplished in B.2
- ✅ Created ShutdownController and ShutdownToken system
- ✅ Integrated shutdown with SessionManager, proxies, and recorder
- ✅ Added signal handling (Ctrl+C) in main.rs
- ✅ Created 7 comprehensive shutdown tests
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with 5 new clippy warning patterns
- ✅ All 679 tests passing, no clippy warnings

## Next Tasks in Phase B

### B.3: Create Library Facade (3 hours) - RECOMMENDED NEXT
- File: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.3-library-facade.md`
- Design high-level API for common use cases
- `Shadowcat::forward_proxy()` and `Shadowcat::reverse_proxy()` convenience methods
- Make the library easy to use for external consumers

### B.4: Extract Transport Factory (3 hours)
- File: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.4-transport-factory.md`
- Note: We already have `TransportFactory` in builders.rs, may just need refinement
- Create a unified factory for all transport types

### B.5: Standardize Error Handling (2 hours)
- File: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.5-error-handling.md`
- Improve error context and chaining
- Ensure consistent error messages across the codebase

### B.6: Add Basic Integration Tests (2 hours)
- File: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.6-integration-tests.md`
- Test all builders work correctly in real scenarios
- Add end-to-end tests for common use cases

## Commands to Start With

```bash
# Navigate to the worktree
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor

# Verify current state
cargo test --lib    # Should show 679 tests passing
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings    # Should show no warnings

# Start with B.3 task
cat plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.3-library-facade.md
```

## Progress Summary
- **Phase A**: 100% Complete (7 hours)
- **Phase B**: 50% Complete (10 of 20 hours)
  - B.1: ✅ Complete (6h)
  - B.2: ✅ Complete (4h)
  - B.3-B.6: ⬜ Not Started (10h remaining)
- **Phase C**: 0% Complete (27 hours)
- **Overall**: ~25% Complete (17 of 60-70 hours)

## Important Notes

The codebase is now in excellent shape after B.2:
- Clean builder patterns for all major components
- Comprehensive shutdown system with signal handling
- No unused code or fields
- All tests passing with no clippy warnings
- Ready for the library facade implementation

Focus on B.3 (Library Facade) next as it will provide the high-level API that makes Shadowcat easy to use as a library. This builds directly on top of the builders and shutdown system we've implemented.

## Key Achievements So Far
1. **Architecture**: CLI is now private, library-first design
2. **Configuration**: Centralized with ProxyConfig
3. **Builders**: All major components have builder patterns
4. **Shutdown**: Full graceful shutdown system with tests
5. **Code Quality**: No clippy warnings, comprehensive tests

Good luck!
