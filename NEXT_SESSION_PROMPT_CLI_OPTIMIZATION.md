# Next Session: Phase C - Quality & Testing

## Context

We are optimizing Shadowcat's CLI refactor to transform it from a functional CLI tool into a production-ready library. The work is tracked in `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/cli-optimization-tracker.md`.

## Current Status

**Phase A: 100% Complete** ✅ (7 hours)
**Phase B: 100% Complete** ✅ (24 hours) 
**Phase B.7: 100% Complete** ✅ (5 hours)
**Phase C: Ready to Begin** (37 hours)

### Overall Progress: 42% Complete (36 of 73 hours)

## Recent Accomplishments

### Phase B.7 (Completed 2025-08-12)
- Fixed all 5 high-priority issues from code review
- Zero clippy warnings, 873+ tests passing
- Production-ready with graceful shutdown, error context, and safety attributes

### Key Improvements Made:
1. **Library-First Architecture** - Clean separation between library and CLI
2. **Builder Patterns** - Ergonomic APIs for all major components
3. **Graceful Shutdown** - Proper shutdown handling for all proxy types
4. **High-Level API** - Simple Shadowcat struct with handles for lifecycle management
5. **Transport Factory** - Centralized, type-safe transport creation
6. **Domain-Specific Errors** - No more anyhow, proper error types throughout
7. **Comprehensive Testing** - 873+ tests covering all functionality

## Working Directory

The work is happening in a git worktree:
```bash
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor
```

This is a separate worktree of the shadowcat submodule on branch `shadowcat-cli-refactor`.

## Phase C: Quality & Testing (37 hours total)

### Available Tasks (Choose Based on Priority):

#### High Priority - Documentation & Examples (7 hours)
- **C.1: Comprehensive Documentation** (4h) - API docs, README, migration guide
- **C.8: Example Programs** (3h) - Real-world usage examples

#### Medium Priority - Configuration & Observability (9 hours)
- **C.2: Configuration File Support** (3h) - TOML/YAML config files
- **C.4: Add Telemetry/Metrics** (4h) - OpenTelemetry integration
- **C.7: CLI Shell Completions** (2h) - Bash/zsh/fish completions

#### Performance & Testing (13 hours)
- **C.5: Performance Optimization** (6h) - Profiling and optimization
- **C.6: Extensive Test Coverage** (6h) - Reach 80%+ coverage
- **C.10: Load Testing** (2h) - Stress testing and benchmarks

#### Nice to Have (8 hours)
- **C.3: Improve Error Messages** (2h) - User-friendly error formatting
- **C.9: Connection Pooling** (3h) - Reuse connections for efficiency
- **C.11: Release Preparation** (2h) - Changelog, version bump, release notes

## Recommended Next Session Focus

### Option 1: Documentation Sprint (1 session, 7 hours)
Complete C.1 and C.8 to make the library immediately usable:
- Write comprehensive API documentation
- Create README with quick start guide
- Build 5-6 example programs showing common use cases
- Document migration from CLI to library usage

### Option 2: Configuration & Observability (1 session, 7 hours)
Complete C.2 and C.4 to add production features:
- Add TOML/YAML configuration file support
- Integrate OpenTelemetry for metrics and tracing
- Add structured logging with tracing

### Option 3: Performance & Testing Sprint (1 session, 8 hours)
Complete C.5 and C.10 to ensure production readiness:
- Profile current performance
- Optimize hot paths
- Add comprehensive benchmarks
- Load test with 10k+ concurrent connections

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Navigate to worktree
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor

# Check current status
git status
cargo test --quiet  # Should show 873+ tests passing
cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Should have 0 warnings

# Build and test
cargo build --release
cargo test
cargo bench  # If doing performance work

# Run example
cargo run -- forward stdio -- echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ping","id":1}'
```

## Key Files to Reference

### Tracker and Plans
- `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/cli-optimization-tracker.md` - Main tracker
- `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/C.*.md` - Task definitions for Phase C

### Core Implementation
- `src/lib.rs` - Library public API
- `src/api.rs` - High-level Shadowcat API and builders
- `src/transport/factory.rs` - Transport factory
- `src/proxy/builders.rs` - Proxy builders
- `examples/` - Example programs (if C.8 completed)

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Main documentation (needs update in C.1)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history (needs creation in C.11)
- `docs/` - Additional documentation (if created in C.1)

## Success Criteria for Phase C

Based on which tasks are completed:

### Documentation (C.1, C.8)
- [ ] All public APIs have rustdoc comments
- [ ] README has installation, quick start, and examples
- [ ] At least 5 working example programs
- [ ] Migration guide from CLI to library

### Configuration (C.2, C.7)
- [ ] Support for TOML/YAML config files
- [ ] Environment variable overrides
- [ ] Shell completions for major shells

### Observability (C.4)
- [ ] OpenTelemetry integration
- [ ] Metrics for latency, throughput, errors
- [ ] Distributed tracing support
- [ ] Structured logging

### Performance (C.5, C.6, C.10)
- [ ] < 5% latency overhead verified
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Benchmarks for all critical paths
- [ ] Successfully handles 10k concurrent connections

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **Single Crate** - Using feature flags instead of workspace
2. **Builder Pattern** - All major types have builders
3. **Handle-Based API** - Proxy operations return handles for lifecycle management
4. **Transport Factory** - Centralized transport creation with TransportSpec enum
5. **Domain Errors** - Specific error types, no anyhow in public API

## Current Test Status

```
Total Tests: 873+
All Passing: Yes
Coverage: ~70% (estimate)
Clippy: Zero warnings
```

## Notes for Next Session

1. **Branch Status**: Working in `shadowcat-cli-refactor` branch in worktree
2. **Main Branch**: Has old CLI refactor already merged
3. **Parent Repo**: Tapwire repository has shadowcat as a submodule
4. **Commit Style**: Don't mention Claude in commits

## Potential Challenges

1. **Documentation**: Need to balance between API docs and user guides
2. **Config Files**: Need to maintain backward compatibility with CLI args
3. **Telemetry**: Must be optional and have minimal overhead
4. **Performance**: Already optimized, further gains may be marginal

## Questions to Consider

1. Should we prioritize documentation for immediate usability?
2. Is OpenTelemetry integration needed before production?
3. Should we target 80% or 90% test coverage?
4. Do we need all Phase C tasks or just the high-priority ones?

## Next Steps After Phase C

Once Phase C is complete (or partially complete based on priorities):
1. Merge `shadowcat-cli-refactor` branch to main
2. Update tapwire repository's submodule reference
3. Create GitHub release with changelog
4. Publish to crates.io (if desired)
5. Update tapwire integration to use new library API
