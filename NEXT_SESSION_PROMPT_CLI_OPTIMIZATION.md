# Next Session: Continue Phase B - Library Readiness

## Context
Task B.1 (Builder Patterns) has been successfully completed! All build errors have been fixed, all tests are passing, and the code is clean with no clippy warnings.

## Current State
- **Branch**: `shadowcat-cli-refactor` (git worktree at `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor`)
- **Phase A**: ✅ Complete (CLI module hidden, exit() removed, config centralized)
- **Phase B.1**: ✅ Complete (Builder patterns implemented, all tests passing)
- **Planning**: Full tracker at `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/cli-optimization-tracker.md`

## What Was Accomplished in B.1
- ✅ Implemented builder patterns for Transport, Proxy, Session, and Interceptor
- ✅ Fixed all type mismatches and API inconsistencies
- ✅ Removed unused fields and cleaned up code properly
- ✅ All 675 tests passing
- ✅ No clippy warnings
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

## Next Tasks in Phase B

### B.2: Add Graceful Shutdown (4 hours) - RECOMMENDED NEXT
- File: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.2-graceful-shutdown.md`
- Implement proper shutdown handling with connection draining
- Add cancellation tokens throughout
- Ensure all resources are cleaned up properly

### B.3: Create Library Facade (3 hours)
- File: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.3-library-facade.md`
- Design high-level API for common use cases
- `Shadowcat::forward_proxy()` and `Shadowcat::reverse_proxy()` convenience methods
- Make the library easy to use for external consumers

### B.4: Extract Transport Factory (3 hours)
- File: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.4-transport-factory.md`
- Note: We already have `TransportFactory` in builders.rs, may just need refinement
- Create a unified factory for all transport types

### B.5: Standardize Error Handling (2 hours)
- File: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.5-error-handling.md`
- Improve error context and chaining
- Ensure consistent error messages across the codebase

### B.6: Add Basic Integration Tests (2 hours)
- File: `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.6-integration-tests.md`
- Test all builders work correctly in real scenarios
- Add end-to-end tests for common use cases

## Commands to Start With

```bash
# Navigate to the worktree
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor

# Verify current state
cargo test --lib    # Should show 675 tests passing
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings    # Should show no warnings

# Start with B.2 task
cat plans/cli-refactor-optimization/tasks/B.2-graceful-shutdown.md
```

## Progress Summary
- **Phase A**: 100% Complete (7 hours)
- **Phase B**: 30% Complete (6 of 20 hours)
  - B.1: ✅ Complete (6h)
  - B.2-B.6: ⬜ Not Started (14h remaining)
- **Phase C**: 0% Complete (27 hours)

## Important Notes

The codebase is now in excellent shape after B.1:
- Clean builder patterns for all major components
- No unused code or fields
- All tests passing
- Ready for the next phase of improvements

Focus on B.2 (Graceful Shutdown) next as it's critical for production readiness and will improve the overall robustness of the system.

Good luck!
