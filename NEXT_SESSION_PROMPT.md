# Next Session Prompt - MCP Compliance Task 1.5

## Current Status
- **Project**: Tapwire/Shadowcat MCP Compliance Initiative
- **Progress**: 31.0% complete (9 of 29 tasks)
- **Phase 1**: 80% complete (4 of 5 tasks)
- **Just Completed**: Task 1.4 - SSE Session Integration

## Completed in Previous Session (Task 1.4)
1. ✅ Created complete SSE session integration module
2. ✅ Implemented SessionAwareSseManager with lifecycle management
3. ✅ Added session-scoped event tracking and ID generation
4. ✅ Integrated session headers (Mcp-Session-Id, MCP-Protocol-Version)
5. ✅ Automatic session expiry with configurable timeouts
6. ✅ All 85 SSE tests passing (up from 72), no clippy warnings

## Key Implementation Notes from Task 1.4
- **Session Integration Complete**: Full session-aware SSE management with lifecycle hooks
- **No block_on() Pattern**: Successfully maintained async state machine pattern throughout
- **Module Structure**: Clean separation between session state (`session/sse_integration.rs`) and SSE management (`transport/sse/session.rs`)
- **Thread Safety**: All shared state uses Arc<RwLock> for concurrent access
- **Performance**: Efficient session lookup with HashMap, connection limits enforced

## Next Task: 1.5 - SSE Performance Optimization

**File**: `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/plans/mcp-compliance/tasks/phase-1-task-005-sse-performance.md`

### Objectives
1. Profile SSE implementation for bottlenecks
2. Optimize buffer management and parsing
3. Implement connection pooling
4. Add performance benchmarks
5. Ensure < 5% latency overhead target

### Foundation from Task 1.4
- Complete session integration with `SessionAwareSseManager`
- Session-scoped event tracking with `SessionEventIdGenerator`
- Lifecycle hooks and automatic expiry monitoring
- Connection limits and proper resource cleanup

### Phase 1 Completion
With Task 1.5, Phase 1 (Core SSE Implementation) will be complete. This final task focuses on performance optimization to ensure the implementation meets the < 5% latency overhead target.

## Key Files
- **Main work area**: `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat/src/transport/sse/`
- **Session system**: `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat/src/session/`
- **Compliance tracker**: `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/plans/mcp-compliance/compliance-tracker.md`
- **Task spec**: `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/plans/mcp-compliance/tasks/phase-1-task-004-sse-session-integration.md`

## Commands to Run First
```bash
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat
cargo test sse -- --quiet  # Verify all 67 tests still pass
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings  # Check for warnings
```

## Important Context
- Shadowcat is a git submodule - commit changes in shadowcat repo first, then update parent
- Target < 5% performance overhead for all operations
- Session timeout defaults: 30 minutes total, 5 minutes idle
- Max 10 connections per session by default

## Success Criteria for Task 1.4
- [ ] SSE connections properly associated with sessions
- [ ] Session ID headers included in all SSE requests
- [ ] Event IDs scoped to sessions as per spec
- [ ] Clean connection cleanup on session termination
- [ ] Session state preserved across reconnections
- [ ] Multiple streams per session properly managed
- [ ] Session expiry handled gracefully
- [ ] Proper isolation between sessions
- [ ] Test coverage for session scenarios

## Notes
- The SSE implementation is now very robust with excellent error handling
- Performance has been optimized based on rust-code-reviewer analysis
- Documentation is comprehensive - use it as a reference
- The async patterns are critical - follow them carefully to avoid deadlocks
