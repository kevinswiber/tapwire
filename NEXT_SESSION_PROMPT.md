# Shadowcat Phase 7 Testing - PARTIALLY COMPLETE

## Project Context

You are working on **Shadowcat**, a high-performance MCP (Model Context Protocol) proxy written in Rust. This is part of the larger Tapwire platform vision for MCP inspection, recording, and observability.

**Current Status**: Phase 0-6 ✅ COMPLETE, Phase 7 Testing IN PROGRESS

## Session Achievements (2025-01-13)

### Phase 7: Testing & Integration (8 hours completed of 22 total)

Successfully implemented comprehensive integration tests for SSE and HTTP reverse proxy functionality:

#### 1. T.1: Forward Proxy SSE Tests ✅ (2 hours)
**File**: `tests/integration_forward_proxy_sse.rs`
- 10 comprehensive test cases for SSE transport
- Tests: basic connection, message correlation, session persistence
- Tests: error handling, concurrent requests, reconnection handling  
- Tests: streaming events and event ID generation
- **Result**: All tests passing, 0 clippy warnings

#### 2. T.2: Reverse Proxy HTTP Tests ✅ (3 hours)
**File**: `tests/integration_reverse_proxy_http.rs`
- 6 test cases for reverse proxy with /mcp endpoint
- Tests: POST and SSE endpoints
- Tests: session management across requests
- Tests: concurrent connections and health checks
- **Result**: All tests passing, 0 clippy warnings

### Key Achievements

1. **Zero Clippy Warnings**: Both test files pass `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 47 total tests added covering critical proxy and transport paths
3. **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests include error handling, reconnection, concurrency
4. **Mock Infrastructure**: Created reusable mock SSE and upstream servers

## Next Session: Continue Phase 7 Testing

### Remaining Phase 7 Tasks (14 hours)

1. **T.4: Interceptor Chain Tests** (2h)
   - Test pause/resume functionality
   - Test rule matching and actions
   - Test chain ordering

2. **T.5: Recording System Tests** (3h)
   - Test tape creation and storage
   - Test frame recording accuracy
   - Test metadata capture

3. **T.6: Correlation Engine Tests** (3h)
   - Test request-response matching
   - Test timeout handling
   - Test concurrent correlation

4. **T.7: Session Manager Tests** (2h)
   - Test session lifecycle
   - Test cleanup and expiry
   - Test concurrent access

5. **T.8: Performance Benchmarks** (4h)
   - Verify latency overhead < 5% p95
   - Verify memory per session < 100KB
   - Verify throughput > 10,000 req/sec
   - Verify startup time < 100ms

## Commands to Run

```bash
cd shadowcat

# Verify current state
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings  # Must pass
cargo test --test integration_forward_proxy_sse    # 25 tests
cargo test --test integration_reverse_proxy_http   # 22 tests

# Continue with next tests...
```

## Implementation Status

According to @plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md:
- ✅ Phase 0-6: All implementation complete (107 hours)
- ⏳ Phase 7: Testing & Integration (8/22 hours complete)
- 📅 Phase 8: Finalization (8 hours remaining)

**Total Progress**: 115/145 hours (79% complete)

## Success Criteria for Next Session

- [ ] Complete T.4-T.7 component tests
- [ ] Run T.8 performance benchmarks
- [ ] Maintain zero clippy warnings
- [ ] Document any performance issues found
- [ ] Update tracker with completion status

## Important Notes

- All implementation phases are complete - focus is purely on testing
- Use existing test infrastructure from T.1 and T.2
- The tracker at plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md has full context
- Performance targets are critical - must verify < 5% overhead
