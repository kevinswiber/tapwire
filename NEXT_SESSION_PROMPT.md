# Next Session Prompt

## ðŸŽ‰ Transport Context Refactor COMPLETE!

The Transport Context Refactor is 100% finished! We successfully refactored Shadowcat's transport layer to use the new MessageEnvelope architecture, separating protocol messages from transport metadata. All tests are passing and the code is clippy-clean.

**Refactor Stats:**
- Completed in 17.5 hours (vs 60 hour estimate - 71% reduction!)
- All 3 phases complete
- Zero backward compatibility needed (no users yet)
- Clean, maintainable architecture ready for SSE

## What's Ready Now

With the Transport Context Refactor complete, we can now proceed with:

1. **SSE Proxy Integration** - The main goal! TransportContext now properly handles SSE metadata
2. **Enhanced Metrics** - Context provides all needed metadata for detailed metrics
3. **Better Error Handling** - Full context available everywhere for debugging

## Recommended Next Task: SSE Proxy Integration

**Reference**: `plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md`

The SSE proxy work was blocked on the Transport Context Refactor. Now that it's complete, we can:

1. Implement SSE-specific transport using the new TransportContext
2. Handle SSE event types, IDs, and retry logic properly
3. Build the reverse proxy SSE support we need

### Quick Start for SSE Work

```bash
cd shadowcat

# Review the SSE proxy plan
cat ../plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md

# The new TransportContext::sse() is ready to use:
# - Event ID tracking
# - Event type support
# - Retry timing
# - Last-Event-ID handling

# Start with implementing SseTransport using the new envelope system
```

## Alternative Tasks

If not continuing with SSE, here are other high-value tasks:

1. **Performance Benchmarking** - Measure the impact of the refactor
2. **Enhanced Interceptors** - Use the new context for smarter interception
3. **Session Metrics** - Build detailed metrics using MessageContext
4. **Protocol Version Negotiation** - Improve using context metadata

## Key Files to Reference

- `src/transport/envelope.rs` - The new MessageEnvelope system
- `plans/transport-context-refactor/PROGRESS.md` - Detailed refactor notes
- `plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md` - SSE proxy requirements

## Notes

- All code is clean and tested
- No technical debt from the refactor
- Architecture is ready for any transport type
- We have full flexibility with no external users

The foundation is solid. Time to build the SSE proxy! ðŸš€
