# Continue Shadowcat MCP Implementation - Complete Phase 4 Interceptor Integration

## Context

I'm working on Shadowcat, a high-performance MCP (Model Context Protocol) proxy in Rust. We're following the unified tracker at `plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md`.

## Current Status

- **Phase 3: 100% Complete** âœ…
  - All MCP message handling components implemented
  - Correlation engine fully integrated with SSE transport
  - Code review improvements applied (Debug derive, performance optimizations, better tests)

- **Phase 4: 20% In Progress** ðŸ”„
  - I.1 (Message Interceptor Interface) - Started with `McpInterceptor` implementation
  - Created MCP-aware conditions and actions in `src/interceptor/mcp_interceptor.rs`
  - Need to complete integration and remaining tasks

## Review These Files First

1. **plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md** - Overall progress tracker
2. **src/interceptor/mcp_interceptor.rs** - Current MCP interceptor implementation (partially complete)
3. **src/interceptor/engine.rs** - Base interceptor system to integrate with
4. **plans/mcp-message-handling/interceptor-mcp-spec.md** - Full specification for MCP interceptor

## Primary Tasks: Complete Phase 4

### I.1: Complete Message Interceptor Interface (2h remaining)
- âœ… Created basic McpInterceptor structure
- âœ… Defined McpCondition and McpAction enums
- â¬œ Add to interceptor module exports
- â¬œ Create builder pattern for easy configuration
- â¬œ Add more comprehensive tests

### I.2: Method-Based Rules Engine (5h)
- Implement rule evaluation engine
- Support complex condition combinations (All, Any, Not)
- Add rule priority and conflict resolution
- Create rule validation and optimization

### I.3: Interceptor Chain Integration (3h)
- Wire McpInterceptor into the existing InterceptorChain
- Ensure proper ordering with other interceptors
- Add configuration for enabling/disabling MCP interception
- Test with forward and reverse proxies

### I.4: SSE Stream Interception (3h)
- Integrate interceptor with SSE transport
- Handle streaming message interception
- Support modification of SSE events in-flight
- Test with real SSE streams

### I.5: Reverse Proxy Interception (2h)
- Add interception to reverse proxy /mcp endpoint
- Support request/response modification
- Add authentication-aware interception
- Test with various MCP clients

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete McpInterceptor Implementation**
   - All condition types evaluated correctly
   - All action types executed properly
   - Thread-safe rule management

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interceptor with real MCP messages
   - Verify rule matching and action execution
   - Test performance impact (< 5% overhead)

3. **Documentation**
   - Document rule configuration format
   - Add examples for common use cases
   - Update CLI help for interceptor commands

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Thread Safety**: McpInterceptor uses Arc<RwLock> for rules - ensure no deadlocks
2. **Performance**: Rule evaluation should be optimized for hot path
3. **Compatibility**: Must work with both protocol versions (2025-03-26 and 2025-06-18)
4. **Error Handling**: Interceptor failures should not break message flow

## Commands to Run

```bash
cd shadowcat

# Check current state
cargo test interceptor::mcp_interceptor
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# After changes
cargo test interceptor::
cargo test --test integration_test  # If integration tests exist

# Run with interceptor
cargo run -- forward stdio --intercept-config rules.yaml -- your-mcp-server
```

## Next Steps After Phase 4

Once Phase 4 is complete, we'll move to Phase 5 (MCP-Aware Recorder):
- C.1: MCP Tape Format (4h)
- C.2: Session Recorder (5h)
- C.3: Storage Backend (3h)
- C.4: SSE Recording Integration (2h)
- C.5: Reverse Proxy Recording (2h)

## Important Context from Previous Session

- We applied all rust-code-reviewer recommendations for Phase 3
- CorrelationEngine now has Debug derive
- Resource cleanup order fixed (connections close before engine stops)
- Performance optimizations reduced cloning and JSON operations
- Comprehensive integration tests added for correlation flow

## Architecture Decisions

1. **McpInterceptor as Separate Type**: Rather than modifying the base Interceptor trait, we created a specialized MCP-aware interceptor that implements the trait
2. **Rule-Based System**: Using declarative rules makes it easy to configure without code changes
3. **Correlation Integration**: The interceptor can leverage correlation data for stateful rules

## Risk Areas

1. **Performance**: Complex rule evaluation could impact latency
2. **Memory**: Storing many rules and tracking state could increase memory usage
3. **Compatibility**: Need to handle both MCP protocol versions correctly

Start by completing I.1 (finishing the McpInterceptor implementation), then move through the remaining Phase 4 tasks systematically.
