Continue Shadowcat MCP Implementation - Complete Phase 4 and Start Phase 5

## Context

I'm working on Shadowcat, a high-performance MCP (Model Context Protocol) proxy in Rust. We're following the unified tracker at plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md.

## Current Status

- **Phase 3**: 100% Complete âœ…
  - All MCP message handling components implemented
  - Correlation engine fully integrated with SSE transport
  
- **Phase 4**: 60% Complete ðŸ”„
  - I.1 âœ… Message Interceptor Interface - Complete with builder pattern, comprehensive tests
  - I.2 âœ… Method-Based Rules Engine - McpRulesEngine with optimization, caching, validation
  - I.3 âœ… Interceptor Chain Integration - Added to InterceptorChainBuilder with tests
  - I.4 â¬œ SSE Stream Interception - Need to integrate with SSE transport
  - I.5 â¬œ Reverse Proxy Interception - Need to add to /mcp endpoint
  - **Code Review**: âœ… All rust-code-reviewer findings addressed (clippy fixes, LRU cache, better error handling)

## Review These Files First

1. plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md - Overall progress tracker (Phase 4 60% complete)
2. src/interceptor/mcp_interceptor.rs - Complete MCP interceptor implementation
3. src/interceptor/mcp_rules_engine.rs - Advanced rules engine with optimization
4. src/interceptor/builder.rs - Updated with MCP interceptor integration

## Primary Tasks: Complete Phase 4

### I.4: SSE Stream Interception (3h)
- Integrate interceptor with SSE transport in src/transport/sse_transport.rs
- Handle streaming message interception
- Support modification of SSE events in-flight
- Test with real SSE streams

### I.5: Reverse Proxy Interception (2h)
- Add interception to reverse proxy /mcp endpoint in src/proxy/reverse.rs
- Support request/response modification
- Add authentication-aware interception
- Test with various MCP clients

## Next Phase: Phase 5 (MCP-Aware Recorder)

Once Phase 4 is complete, move to Phase 5:
- C.1: MCP Tape Format (4h)
- C.2: Session Recorder (5h)
- C.3: Storage Backend (3h)
- C.4: SSE Recording Integration (2h)
- C.5: Reverse Proxy Recording (2h)

## Key Accomplishments from Previous Session

### Phase 4 Progress (I.1, I.2, I.3 Complete + Code Review)

1. **McpInterceptor Implementation** (src/interceptor/mcp_interceptor.rs)
   - Full condition evaluation (method matching, params, protocol version)
   - Action execution (allow, block, delay, modify params, inject errors)
   - Builder pattern for easy configuration
   - Comprehensive test suite (12 tests)
   - Metrics tracking
   - Added warning logs for parameter modification failures

2. **McpRulesEngine** (src/interceptor/mcp_rules_engine.rs)
   - Advanced rule evaluation with optimization
   - Method indexing for fast rule lookup
   - **LRU cache implementation** with proper eviction
   - Rule validation and conflict detection
   - Statistics tracking
   - **Improved cache key generation** including params fingerprint
   - Fixed rule priority ordering in results

3. **InterceptorChain Integration** (src/interceptor/builder.rs)
   - Added mcp_interceptor() method to chain builder
   - Added mcp_interceptor_with_builder() for inline configuration
   - Full test coverage for integration

4. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - All clippy warnings resolved
   - Better error handling with logging
   - Safe array access with bounds checking
   - Optimized string operations with strip_prefix
   - 16 comprehensive tests all passing

## Implementation Notes

### For I.4 (SSE Stream Interception)
- The SSE transport is in src/transport/sse_transport.rs
- Need to call interceptor chain in send() and receive() methods
- Consider streaming nature - may need to buffer for complete messages
- Handle SSE-specific metadata (event_id, event_type)

### For I.5 (Reverse Proxy Interception)
- Reverse proxy /mcp endpoint is in src/proxy/reverse.rs
- Look for handle_mcp_request or similar method
- Apply interceptors to both incoming requests and outgoing responses
- Consider authentication context when intercepting

## Commands to Run

```bash
cd shadowcat

# Test current implementation
cargo test interceptor::mcp
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Test SSE integration (after I.4)
cargo test transport::sse

# Test reverse proxy (after I.5)
cargo test proxy::reverse

# Run full integration test
cargo test --test integration_test
```

## Success Criteria

1. **Phase 4 Completion**
   - SSE messages intercepted and can be modified
   - Reverse proxy applies MCP rules
   - Performance overhead < 5%
   - All tests pass, no clippy warnings

2. **Ready for Phase 5**
   - Clear understanding of message flow
   - Interceptor chain working end-to-end
   - Documentation updated

## Risk Areas

1. **SSE Buffering**: Need to handle partial messages in stream
2. **Performance**: Rule evaluation in hot path needs optimization
3. **Compatibility**: Both MCP protocol versions must work

Start with I.4 (SSE Stream Interception) by examining the current SSE transport implementation and adding interceptor hooks.
