# Continue Shadowcat Phase 5B Day 6+: Rate Limiting and Advanced Features

I'm implementing Shadowcat, an MCP (Model Context Protocol) proxy in Rust. Phase 5B Days 1-5 are complete with OAuth 2.1, JWT validation, AuthGateway enhancement, HTTP policy engine integration, and circuit breaker implementation. Now I need to continue with Day 6+: Rate Limiting and Advanced Features.

## Current Status
- **Repository:** `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat` (git submodule in `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire`)
- **Phase:** Phase 5B Days 6+ - Rate Limiting and Advanced Features
- **Previous Work:** Days 1-5 complete (OAuth + JWT + AuthGateway + HTTP Policy + Circuit Breaker)
- **Tests:** 274 passing (98 auth+proxy tests, 23 circuit breaker tests)
- **Achievement:** < 100μs circuit breaker overhead, < 5ms total auth overhead, < 1ms policy evaluation

## What's Complete (Phase 5B Days 1-5)

✅ **Day 1**: OAuth 2.1 with mandatory PKCE (S256 method)
✅ **Day 2**: JWT validation with JWKS (< 1ms performance)
✅ **Day 3**: Enhanced AuthGateway with session management
✅ **Day 4**: HTTP policy engine with interceptor integration
✅ **Day 5**: Circuit breaker with load balancing and health monitoring

## Your Task: Phase 5B Day 6+ - Rate Limiting and Advanced Features

Continue implementing the advanced features of the authentication and resilience system.

### Next Priority: Day 7 - Rate Limiting and Audit System

**Primary Task:** Task 007: Rate Limiting and Audit Logging Integration

### Key Files to Work With:
- **Reference Spec:** `plans/tasks/reverse-proxy/007-rate-limiting-audit.md` (create if needed)
- **Timeline Spec:** `plans/tasks/reverse-proxy/implementation-timeline.md` (see Day 7)
- **Integration Point:** `src/auth/middleware.rs` - Where rate limiting will integrate

### Specifications to Follow:
1. **Primary Timeline:** `plans/tasks/reverse-proxy/implementation-timeline.md` (see Day 7)
2. **Master Plan:** `plans/022-phase5b-authentication-implementation-plan.md`
3. **Task Tracker:** `plans/shadowcat-task-tracker.md`

### Key Requirements for Day 7:
1. **Multi-tier Rate Limiting:** Use tower-governor for HTTP-level rate limiting
2. **Audit Logging:** Unified audit logging with tracing integration  
3. **Security Event Monitoring:** Track authentication, authorization, and security events
4. **Performance:** < 100μs rate limiting overhead
5. **Integration:** Seamless with existing AuthGateway middleware

### Success Criteria:
- Rate limiting protects against abuse and DoS attacks
- Audit logging provides security visibility and compliance
- Performance targets maintained (< 100μs rate limiting overhead)
- Integration with existing authentication and policy systems
- Comprehensive tests for all rate limiting scenarios

### Context Documents:

**Review these for full context:**
- `plans/shadowcat-task-tracker.md` - Current progress and architecture  
- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - What we just completed
- `plans/tasks/reverse-proxy/implementation-timeline.md` - Timeline and dependencies
- `plans/022-phase5b-authentication-implementation-plan.md` - Master implementation plan

### Testing Commands:
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat

# Run existing tests
cargo test --lib auth  # Current auth tests (85 passing)
cargo test --lib proxy  # Current proxy tests including circuit breaker

# After implementation
cargo test --lib --all  # Should maintain 274+ passing
```

### Implementation Approach:
1. Review existing `src/auth/middleware.rs` implementation
2. Add tower-governor dependency and rate limiting middleware
3. Implement audit logging with tracing integration
4. Add security event monitoring and metrics
5. Create configuration structures for rate limiting
6. Write comprehensive tests for rate limiting scenarios
7. Update integration tests

### Dependencies Already Available:
```toml
# Available in Cargo.toml
tower_governor = { version = "0.7.0", features = ["axum"] }
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter", "json"] }
```

### Alternative Tasks (if rate limiting blocked):
If rate limiting work is blocked, consider these alternative tasks:
- **Task 008**: End-to-End Integration Testing and Debugging
- **Task 009**: Performance Testing and Optimization  
- **Task 010**: CLI Updates and Documentation

The goal is to add comprehensive rate limiting and audit logging to provide production-ready security monitoring and abuse protection, while maintaining the excellent performance we've achieved so far.

### Current Architecture Context

Shadowcat now has a complete authentication and resilience stack:
- **OAuth 2.1** with PKCE for secure authentication
- **JWT validation** with < 1ms performance  
- **AuthGateway** with session management and middleware
- **HTTP policy engine** with < 1ms evaluation
- **Circuit breaker** with < 100μs overhead and automatic recovery
- **Load balancing** with health monitoring and multiple strategies

The next layer is rate limiting and audit logging to complete the production security suite.
