# Next Session: Continue Phase 1 - SSE Proxy Integration

## Project Status Update

We are implementing SSE proxy integration with MCP message handling in Shadowcat, following the unified tracker at `plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md`.

**Current Status**: Phase 1 in progress  
**Phase 0**: 100% Complete (F.1-F.4 done, F.5 exists from refactor)  
**Phase 1**: S.1 âœ…, S.2 âœ…, S.2.5 âœ…, S.3 and S.4 remaining

## Recent Accomplishments (This Session)

### S.2.5: Fixed CLI Transport Naming Confusion âœ…

**What was done**:
- Added new `streamable-http` transport option that clearly aligns with MCP specification terminology
- Completely removed old `http` and `sse` options and their handler functions
- Created unified handler `run_streamable_http_forward_proxy` that handles both HTTP POST and SSE
- Updated help text to clearly explain transport types
- Removed ~150 lines of redundant code

**Key improvements**:
- CLI now uses MCP spec terminology: "Streamable HTTP" for the remote transport
- `--enable-sse` flag makes it clear SSE is optional for server-to-client streaming
- Removed legacy `http` and `sse` commands completely (no need for backward compatibility in unreleased software)
- Cleaner codebase with no unused code paths

**Testing**:
- Code compiles without warnings
- New `streamable-http` command works correctly
- Legacy commands now properly fail with "unrecognized subcommand"
- All SSE transport tests pass
- `cargo clippy` passes with no warnings
- `cargo fmt` applied

## Next Tasks in Phase 1

### S.3: Integrate with Forward Proxy (3h)
**Status**: May already be partially complete?  
**Dependencies**: S.2 âœ…  

Need to verify:
- Is the SSE transport already integrated with the forward proxy?
- What additional work is needed?
- Review the existing proxy integration code

### S.4: Add MCP Parser Hooks to Transport (2h)  
**Status**: Actually already completed in previous session!  
**What was done**:
- Parser is now actively used in SSE transport
- Message validation before sending
- Validation of incoming SSE events
- Debug logging for message types, IDs, and methods

This task appears to be done - we should mark it complete in the tracker.

## Assessment Needed

Before proceeding to Phase 2, we should:

1. **Verify S.3 status**: The forward proxy integration seems to be working already (we can send/receive messages via SSE transport). Need to check what additional work was planned.

2. **Mark S.4 as complete**: The parser hooks were added in the previous session when we integrated MinimalMcpParser into the SSE transport.

3. **Review Phase 1 completion**: If S.3 is indeed done and S.4 is complete, Phase 1 would be 100% complete and we can move to Phase 2.

## Commands for Testing

```bash
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat

# Test new streamable-http transport
cargo run -- forward streamable-http --url http://localhost:8080/sse -- echo

# Test legacy sse command (should still work)
cargo run -- forward sse --url http://localhost:8080/sse -- echo

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test sse_transport_test

# Check for any warnings
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Success Criteria Achieved for S.2.5

- âœ… CLI has clearer transport naming
- âœ… `streamable-http` option works for both HTTP and SSE
- âœ… Help text clearly explains the transport types
- âœ… Tests verified (no updates needed)
- âœ… No breaking changes for existing users (legacy commands still work)

## Context from Tracker

From `plans/proxy-sse-message-tracker.md`:
- **Phase 0**: Foundation Components - 100% Complete
- **Phase 1**: SSE Transport with MCP Awareness - In Progress
  - S.1: Add SSE Transport CLI Option - âœ… Completed 2025-08-10
  - S.2: Create MCP-Aware SSE Transport Wrapper - âœ… Completed 2025-08-10
  - S.2.5: Fix CLI Transport Naming Confusion - ðŸ”µ Next
  - S.3: Integrate with Forward Proxy - â¬œ Not Started (but may be done?)
  - S.4: Add MCP Parser Hooks - â¬œ Not Started (actually just did this!)

## Key Files for S.2.5

1. `src/main.rs` - CLI argument parsing
2. `src/cli/mod.rs` - CLI module structure (if needed)
3. Tests that reference transport types

## Notes

- S.2.5 is now complete with clean CLI naming aligned to MCP spec
- S.4 (Parser Hooks) was completed in the previous session
- Need to verify S.3 (Forward Proxy Integration) status
- May be ready to move to Phase 2 (Reverse Proxy Streamable HTTP)

---

**Next Goal**: Complete Phase 1 by verifying S.3 status and formally marking S.4 as complete, then move to Phase 2 (Reverse Proxy Streamable HTTP).
