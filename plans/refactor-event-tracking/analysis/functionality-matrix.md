### Legend
- ✅ Fully implemented and working
- ⚠️ Partially implemented
- ❌ Not implemented or not working
- 🔄 Planned/Interface exists
- Dead code = Never used in production

## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps
1. **No Persistence Wiring**: Session Store has the interface but isn't connected to any tracking
2. **No Proxy Integration**: Reverse proxy doesn't use transport EventTracker
3. **No Interceptor Support**: None of the systems integrate with interceptors
4. **Duplicate Deduplication**: Only transport has it, others would need it

### Redundancies
1. **Triple Event ID Storage**: Session, ConnectionInfo, and SseConnection all store the same data
2. **Dual EventTracker Creation**: Both ReconnectionManager and SseSessionState create trackers
3. **Parallel Health Monitoring**: Multiple systems have their own HealthMonitor instances

### Missing Features
1. **Distributed Coordination**: No mechanism for multi-instance synchronization
2. **Batch Event Support**: No tracking for batch message handling
3. **Event ID Validation**: No validation of event ID format or sequence
4. **Metrics Collection**: Limited observability into tracking behavior

## Functionality by Use Case

### Use Case: SSE Reconnection After Network Failure
**Current State**: ⚠️ Partially Working
- ✅ Transport EventTracker maintains circular buffer
- ✅ Can detect and filter duplicate events
- ❌ Reverse proxy doesn't use this for client reconnection
- ❌ Session persistence not updated

**Required**: Transport EventTracker + Session persistence + Reverse proxy integration

### Use Case: Multiple Connections Per Session
**Current State**: ⚠️ Isolated Implementation
- ✅ SseSessionState tracks multiple ConnectionInfo objects
- ✅ Each connection has its own last_event_id
- ❌ Not integrated with transport EventTracker
- ❌ No deduplication across connections

**Required**: Unified tracking across all connections in a session

### Use Case: Server Restart Recovery
**Current State**: ❌ Not Implemented
- ✅ Session Store has the interface
- ❌ Never receives event ID updates
- ❌ No persistence to disk/database
- ❌ No recovery mechanism on startup

**Required**: Transport → Session Store updates + Actual persistence

### Use Case: Distributed Proxy Deployment
**Current State**: ❌ Not Supported
- ❌ No Redis/shared storage implementation
- ❌ No distributed lock mechanism
- ❌ No cache invalidation
- ✅ Interface exists for future implementation

**Required**: Redis session store + Distributed EventTracker

## Consolidation Opportunities

### High Value - Low Effort
1. **Delete ReverseProxySseManager**: Dead code removal (1 hour)
2. **Wire Transport to Session**: Simple callback/channel (2 hours)
3. **Remove ConnectionInfo.last_event_id**: Use tracker instead (1 hour)

### High Value - Medium Effort
1. **Unify EventTracker Usage**: Single instance per session (3 hours)
2. **Add Interceptor Hooks**: Event ID updates trigger interceptors (3 hours)
3. **Implement Session Recovery**: Load last_event_id on reconnect (4 hours)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Redis Backend**: Implement distributed session store (8 hours)
2. **Metrics Dashboard**: Add tracking observability (4 hours)
3. **Event Sequence Validation**: Detect gaps/reordering (6 hours)

## Recommendations

### Minimum Viable Consolidation
Focus on making the transport EventTracker the single source of truth:
1. Delete dead code (ReverseProxySseManager)
2. Wire transport tracker to session persistence
3. Make reverse proxy use transport tracker
4. Remove redundant tracking from ConnectionInfo

### Benefits of Consolidation
- **Simpler Mental Model**: One place to look for event tracking
- **Consistent Behavior**: All components use same deduplication logic
- **Easier Testing**: Single implementation to test
- **Future-Proof**: Clear extension point for Redis/distributed

### Risks of Current State
- **Data Inconsistency**: Multiple sources can diverge
- **Reconnection Failures**: Proxy doesn't use deduplication
- **Memory Leaks**: Unbounded growth in some implementations
- **Maintenance Burden**: Five systems to understand and maintain

## Conclusion

The functionality matrix reveals:
1. **Transport EventTracker is the clear winner** - most complete implementation
2. **ReverseProxySseManager is dead weight** - can be deleted
3. **Session Store is a shell** - has interface but no implementation
4. **Integration is the gap** - systems exist but don't talk to each other

The consolidation path is clearer than expected - it's mostly about wiring existing pieces together and removing dead code, not reimplementing complex functionality.
