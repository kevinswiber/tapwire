# E.0: REMOVED - No Callbacks Needed

**Status**: ‚ùå REMOVED - Using channels directly instead

## Why This Task Was Removed

After review, the callback pattern (both sync and async) was identified as:
- Not idiomatic Rust
- An outlier in the Shadowcat codebase
- Unnecessarily complex
- Harder to test than channels

## Better Solution Adopted

EventTracker now owns the channel sender directly:

```rust
pub struct EventTracker {
    session_id: SessionId,  // Knows its session
    persistence_tx: Option<mpsc::Sender<PersistenceRequest>>,  // Direct ownership
    // ... other fields
}
```

This provides:
- Natural backpressure via channel semantics
- Simpler, more idiomatic code
- Consistency with rest of Shadowcat
- Easier testing

## Impact

- Phase E reduced from 7.5 to 6.5 hours
- E.1 slightly simplified
- No breaking changes needed
- Cleaner architecture
