# Task A.1: MCP Transport Analysis

## Objective
Analyze how Wassette and Shadowcat handle MCP transport to design an effective proxy integration pattern that preserves security boundaries while enabling traffic inspection and recording.

## Key Questions to Answer
1. How does Wassette's stdio transport differ from standard MCP stdio?
2. Can Shadowcat's existing stdio transport proxy Wassette effectively?
3. What modifications are needed to Shadowcat's transport layer?
4. How do we handle bidirectional communication in the proxy?
5. What are the message framing and buffering requirements?
6. How do we preserve Wassette's capability restrictions through the proxy?

## Process

### Step 1: Wassette Transport Analysis
- Examine Wassette's stdio implementation in detail
- Document message format, framing, and protocol
- Identify any Wassette-specific extensions or modifications
- Analyze error handling and connection lifecycle

### Step 2: Shadowcat Transport Review
- Review Shadowcat's current stdio transport implementation
- Analyze the Transport trait and its requirements
- Identify gaps for Wassette compatibility
- Document current proxy patterns for stdio

### Step 3: Protocol Compatibility Check
- Compare MCP protocol versions
- Identify message types that need special handling
- Document any protocol negotiation requirements
- Analyze session management differences

### Step 4: Design Proxy Pattern
- Create sequence diagrams for message flow
- Design adapter pattern for Wassette-Shadowcat bridge
- Plan buffer management and streaming approach
- Consider performance implications

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Analyze Wassette's transport
cd wassette
grep -r "stdin\|stdout\|stdio" --include="*.rs"
grep -r "AsyncRead\|AsyncWrite" --include="*.rs"
grep -r "tokio\|async" --include="*.rs"

# Analyze Shadowcat's transport
cd ../shadowcat
cat src/transport/mod.rs
cat src/transport/stdio.rs
grep -r "StdioTransport" --include="*.rs"

# Test Wassette stdio communication
wassette load example.wasm 2>&1 | tee wassette-output.log
# Analyze the protocol messages

# Test Shadowcat stdio proxy
cargo run -- forward stdio -- echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","id":1}'
```
