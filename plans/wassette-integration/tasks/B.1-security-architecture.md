# Task B.1: Security Architecture

## Objective
Design the comprehensive security architecture for the integrated system, ensuring token isolation, capability preservation, and defense-in-depth while maintaining usability.

## Key Security Requirements
1. Complete token isolation between layers
2. Preserve Wassette's capability model
3. Implement comprehensive audit logging
4. Support component signature verification
5. Enable policy-based access control
6. Provide secure configuration management

## Process

### Step 1: Token Flow Design
- Map token boundaries and isolation points
- Design token stripping mechanism
- Plan credential management
- Specify token rotation strategy

### Step 2: Policy Integration
- Merge Shadowcat and Wassette policies
- Design policy precedence rules
- Plan dynamic policy updates
- Create policy validation framework

### Step 3: Audit System Design
- Define audit event schema
- Plan storage and retention
- Design query interfaces
- Specify compliance reports

### Step 4: Threat Mitigation
- Update threat model with integration
- Design security monitoring
- Plan incident response procedures
- Create security testing framework
