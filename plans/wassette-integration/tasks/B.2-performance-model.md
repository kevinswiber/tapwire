# Task B.2: Performance Model

## Objective
Design the performance architecture to ensure the integrated system meets latency, throughput, and resource utilization targets while maintaining reliability.

## Key Performance Requirements
1. Latency overhead < 5% p95
2. Support 100+ concurrent clients
3. Memory usage < 100MB per client
4. Throughput > 1000 msg/sec
5. Startup time < 100ms
6. Graceful degradation under load

## Process

### Step 1: Performance Modeling
- Create latency budget breakdown
- Model throughput limitations
- Analyze memory usage patterns
- Identify performance bottlenecks

### Step 2: Optimization Strategies
- Design caching layers
- Plan connection pooling
- Optimize buffer management
- Design async processing patterns

### Step 3: Scaling Architecture
- Horizontal scaling patterns
- Load balancing strategies
- Resource pooling design
- Backpressure mechanisms

### Step 4: Monitoring Design
- Performance metrics collection
- Real-time monitoring dashboards
- Alerting thresholds
- Performance testing framework
