# Task A.2: Security Model Evaluation

## Objective
Evaluate the security implications of integrating Wassette's WebAssembly sandbox with Shadowcat's proxy and authentication mechanisms to ensure the combined system maintains strong security boundaries.

## Key Questions to Answer
1. How do Wassette's capability restrictions interact with Shadowcat's proxy layer?
2. Can the proxy accidentally bypass or weaken Wassette's sandbox?
3. How should authentication tokens flow through the system?
4. What are the trust boundaries in the combined architecture?
5. How do we prevent capability escalation through the proxy?
6. What audit and monitoring capabilities are needed?

## Process

### Step 1: Wassette Security Analysis
- Document Wassette's capability-based security model
- Analyze deny-by-default permission system
- Review Wasmtime sandbox implementation
- Understand component signing and verification

### Step 2: Shadowcat Security Review
- Review authentication gateway implementation
- Analyze OAuth 2.1 token handling
- Document proxy security boundaries
- Review audit and logging capabilities

### Step 3: Threat Modeling
- Identify potential attack vectors
- Analyze privilege escalation risks
- Document data flow and trust boundaries
- Consider supply chain security (OCI registries)

### Step 4: Security Architecture Design
- Design unified security model
- Plan token flow and isolation
- Define audit requirements
- Create security best practices

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Analyze Wassette's capability system
cd wassette
grep -r "capability\|permission\|deny" --include="*.rs"
grep -r "wasi\|WASI" --include="*.rs"
find . -name "*.wit" -exec cat {} \;

# Review security-related code
grep -r "verify\|sign\|crypto" --include="*.rs"
grep -r "sandbox\|isolat" --include="*.rs"

# Analyze Shadowcat's auth implementation
cd ../shadowcat
cat src/auth/mod.rs
grep -r "OAuth\|JWT\|token" --include="*.rs"
grep -r "validate\|authorize" --include="*.rs"

# Check for security tests
cargo test security
cargo test auth
```

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Security Requirements Matrix

| Requirement | Wassette | Shadowcat | Combined System | Implementation |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Sandbox isolation | Wasmtime | N/A | Preserved | Direct passthrough |
| Token management | N/A | OAuth 2.1 | Isolated | Token stripping |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete understanding of both security models
- [ ] Identified all security boundaries and trust zones
- [ ] Documented token flow without leakage risks
- [ ] Threat model with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Clear security architecture for combined system
- [ ] Audit and monitoring requirements defined

## Dependencies
- A.0 (Wassette Technical Deep Dive)

## Notes
- Pay special attention to token isolation
- Ensure proxy doesn't become a privilege escalation vector
- Consider defense-in-depth approach
- Document compliance considerations (if any)
- Focus on maintaining Wassette's security guarantees
