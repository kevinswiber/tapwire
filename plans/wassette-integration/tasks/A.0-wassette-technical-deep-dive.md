# Task A.0: Wassette Technical Deep Dive

## Objective
Conduct a comprehensive technical analysis of Wassette to understand its architecture, capabilities, and MCP implementation details necessary for Shadowcat integration.

## Key Questions to Answer
1. What is Wassette's exact MCP transport implementation (stdio, HTTP, SSE)?
2. How does Wassette load and execute WebAssembly components?
3. What is the component lifecycle and state management model?
4. How does Wassette handle MCP protocol negotiation and initialization?
5. What are the exact capability restrictions and how are they enforced?
6. How does the OCI registry integration work for component discovery?
7. What are the performance characteristics and resource requirements?

## Process

### Step 1: Source Code Analysis
- Clone the Wassette repository
- Analyze the Rust codebase structure
- Identify key modules: MCP handler, Wasm runtime, transport layer
- Document the component loading pipeline

### Step 2: MCP Implementation Review
- Examine how Wassette implements MCP server interface
- Identify supported MCP methods and capabilities
- Analyze request/response flow through the system
- Document any MCP extensions or limitations

### Step 3: WebAssembly Integration
- Understand Wasmtime integration details
- Analyze component interface (WIT) handling
- Review sandbox boundaries and capability system
- Document resource limits and constraints

### Step 4: Example Analysis
- Run and analyze provided examples (filesystem-rs, get-weather-js, gomodule-go)
- Trace execution flow from MCP request to Wasm invocation
- Document component packaging and deployment process

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Clone and explore Wassette
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/wassette.git
cd wassette

# Analyze codebase structure
find . -name "*.rs" -type f | head -20
grep -r "MCP\|mcp" --include="*.rs" | head -20
grep -r "stdio\|http" --include="*.rs" | head -20

# Build and test
cargo build
cargo test

# Run examples
cd examples/filesystem-rs
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2
wassette load ./target/wasm32-wasip2/debug/filesystem.wasm

# Analyze transport implementation
grep -r "transport\|Transport" --include="*.rs"
```

# Wassette-Shadowcat Integration Points

| Component | Wassette | Shadowcat | Integration Method |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Transport | stdio | stdio/HTTP/SSE | Proxy adapter |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete understanding of Wassette's MCP transport mechanism
- [ ] Documented component loading and execution pipeline
- [ ] Identified all potential integration points with Shadowcat
- [ ] Clear understanding of security boundaries and capabilities
- [ ] Working local Wassette installation with examples

2 hours

## Dependencies
None

## Notes
- Focus on transport layer as primary integration point
- Pay special attention to stdio implementation for proxying
- Document any undocumented behaviors or limitations
- Note performance bottlenecks or scalability concerns
