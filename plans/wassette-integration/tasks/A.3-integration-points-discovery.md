# Task A.3: Integration Points Discovery

## Objective
Identify and document all viable integration points between Wassette and Shadowcat, creating a comprehensive integration strategy that leverages the strengths of both systems.

## Key Questions to Answer
1. What are all the possible integration patterns?
2. Which integration approach provides the best developer experience?
3. How do we handle component discovery and loading through the proxy?
4. Can we intercept and modify Wassette tool invocations?
5. How does recording/replay work with WebAssembly components?
6. What's the best architecture for production vs development use cases?

## Process

### Step 1: Integration Pattern Analysis
- Document all possible integration architectures
- Analyze pros/cons of each approach
- Consider development vs production scenarios
- Evaluate complexity vs benefits

### Step 2: Component Lifecycle Integration
- Understand component loading through proxy
- Design OCI registry proxy pattern
- Plan component caching strategy
- Handle component updates and versioning

### Step 3: Recording and Replay Design
- Design recording of Wassette tool invocations
- Plan replay mechanism for WebAssembly components
- Consider state management in replay
- Handle non-deterministic operations

### Step 4: Interceptor Integration
- Design interceptor patterns for Wassette messages
- Plan rule-based modifications
- Consider capability-aware interception
- Design debugging and inspection tools

## Integration Patterns to Evaluate

### Pattern 1: Wassette as Upstream
```
Client -> Shadowcat -> Wassette -> Wasm Component
```

### Pattern 2: Shadowcat as Transport Layer
```
Client -> Shadowcat Transport -> Wassette Runtime -> Wasm
```

### Pattern 3: Side-by-Side with Shared Session
```
Client -> Shadowcat (recording)
       -> Wassette (execution)
```

### Pattern 4: Embedded Integration
```
Client -> Shadowcat with Wassette Library -> Wasm
```

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Analyze Wassette's API surface
cd wassette
grep -r "pub fn\|pub struct\|pub trait" --include="*.rs" | head -30

# Check for library vs binary separation
ls -la src/
cat Cargo.toml | grep -A5 "\[lib\]\|\[\[bin\]\]"

# Analyze message handling pipeline
grep -r "handle\|process\|dispatch" --include="*.rs"

# Check Shadowcat's extension points
cd ../shadowcat
grep -r "trait.*Transport\|trait.*Interceptor" --include="*.rs"
cat src/proxy/mod.rs
```
