# Wassette-Shadowcat Integration Analysis

## Overview
This directory contains the analysis outputs for integrating Microsoft's Wassette (WebAssembly-based MCP runtime) with Shadowcat (MCP proxy for recording and inspection).

## Context

### Wassette
Microsoft's Wassette is a security-oriented runtime that executes WebAssembly Components via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Key features:
- **Security**: Browser-grade sandboxing via Wasmtime
- **Capability-based**: Deny-by-default permission system
- **Language agnostic**: Supports components written in Rust, JavaScript, Go, Python
- **Zero dependencies**: Standalone Rust binary
- **OCI Integration**: Can load components from container registries

### Shadowcat
Shadowcat is an MCP proxy providing:
- **Forward/Reverse proxy**: For MCP traffic
- **Recording**: Capture all MCP interactions to "tapes"
- **Replay**: Reproduce recorded sessions
- **Interception**: Modify messages based on rules
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.1 gateway for security

## Integration Vision

The integration of Wassette and Shadowcat enables:

1. **Secure Development Environment**: Developers can safely test untrusted MCP tools in Wassette's sandbox while using Shadowcat to record and debug interactions

2. **Production Observability**: Monitor and audit WebAssembly-based MCP tools in production with full traffic visibility

3. **Enhanced Security**: Combine Wassette's sandboxing with Shadowcat's authentication gateway for defense-in-depth

4. **Tool Development Workflow**: Record real MCP interactions, modify them with interceptors, and replay against Wassette components for testing

## Analysis Structure

### Phase A: Discovery & Analysis
- `wassette-architecture.md` - Technical deep dive into Wassette
- `transport-comparison.md` - MCP transport analysis
- `security-assessment.md` - Security model evaluation
- `integration-points.md` - Integration opportunities

### Phase B: Architecture Design
- `proxy-pattern.md` - Detailed proxy architecture
- `security-architecture.md` - Combined security model
- `performance-model.md` - Performance analysis

### Phase C: Proof of Concept
- Implementation code and documentation
- Test results and benchmarks

### Phase D: Recommendations
- `integration-guide.md` - Step-by-step integration guide
- `deployment-patterns.md` - Production deployment patterns
- `best-practices.md` - Security and performance best practices

## Key Integration Patterns

### 1. Upstream Proxy Pattern (Recommended for Development)
```
MCP Client -> Shadowcat Proxy -> Wassette -> WebAssembly Component
```
**Benefits**: Full traffic visibility, recording/replay, minimal changes
**Use Case**: Development, debugging, testing

### 2. Transport Adapter Pattern (Recommended for Production)
```
MCP Client -> Shadowcat Transport Layer -> Wassette Runtime
```
**Benefits**: Lower latency, tighter integration, production-ready
**Use Case**: Production deployments with monitoring

### 3. Sidecar Pattern (Recommended for Observability)
```
MCP Client -> Shadowcat (Recording) + Wassette (Execution)
```
**Benefits**: Non-invasive monitoring, independent scaling
**Use Case**: Production observability without proxy overhead

## Critical Design Decisions

1. **Transport**: Focus on stdio initially as it's Wassette's primary transport
2. **Security**: Maintain strict isolation between proxy and sandbox layers
3. **Performance**: Target < 10% overhead for proxy operations
4. **Recording**: Store WebAssembly component state for deterministic replay
5. **Interception**: Respect Wassette's capability model in interceptors

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase A discovery tasks
2. Design detailed integration architecture
3. Build proof of concept
4. Performance testing and optimization
5. Security audit
6. Documentation and deployment guides
