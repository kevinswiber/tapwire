# Task A.3: Evaluate Generation Approach

## Objective

Evaluate and decide between build-time and runtime documentation generation approaches, considering maintainability, performance, and flexibility trade-offs.

## Background

Two main approaches exist:
- **Build-time**: Generate docs during compilation (build.rs)
- **Runtime**: Generate docs when --help-doc is invoked

Each has distinct advantages and implications for the implementation.

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What are the performance implications of each approach?
2. How does each approach affect binary size?
3. Which provides better maintainability?
4. How do we handle conditional features?
5. What's the impact on build complexity?

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Analysis Phase (30 min)

Evaluate each approach:

**Runtime Generation:**
- Pros: Dynamic, always current, no build complexity
- Cons: Slight runtime overhead, requires Clap metadata

**Build-time Generation:**
- Pros: Zero runtime overhead, can optimize output
- Cons: Build complexity, static output, versioning issues

### 2. Prototype Phase (20 min)

Create minimal prototypes:
- Runtime: Use Clap introspection
- Build-time: Use build.rs script

### 3. Decision Phase (10 min)

Document decision based on:
- Performance measurements
- Maintenance considerations
- Flexibility requirements

## Expected Deliverables

### Analysis Document
- `analysis/generation-approach.md` - Approach comparison and decision

### Prototype Code
- Minimal examples of each approach
- Performance measurements
- Size impact analysis

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Both approaches evaluated
- [ ] Prototypes created
- [ ] Performance measured
- [ ] Decision documented
- [ ] Rationale clear

## Duration Estimate

**Total: 1 hour**
- Analysis: 30 minutes
- Prototyping: 20 minutes
- Decision: 10 minutes

## Dependencies

- A.0: Research Clap Capabilities (completed)

## Notes

- Recommend starting with runtime for simplicity
- Can optimize to build-time later if needed
- Consider hybrid approach for large static content
