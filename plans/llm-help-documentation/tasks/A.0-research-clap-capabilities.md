# Task A.0: Research Clap Documentation Capabilities

## Objective
Investigate Clap's built-in capabilities for introspection, documentation extraction, and automated documentation generation to determine the best approach for implementing --help-doc.

## Key Questions to Answer
1. **Runtime Introspection**
   - Can we traverse the command tree at runtime?
   - Can we extract all metadata (descriptions, arguments, options)?
   - Is there an API for accessing command structure programmatically?

2. **Documentation Extraction**
   - How do we access long descriptions vs short descriptions?
   - Can we extract examples defined in Clap?
   - How are argument types and validations exposed?
   - Can we get default values programmatically?

3. **Existing Solutions**
   - What does clap_mangen do and can we leverage it?
   - What does clap_complete do for shell completions?
   - Are there other crates that solve similar problems?
   - Examples of projects doing similar documentation generation?

4. **Build-time vs Runtime**
   - Pros/cons of generating at build time with build.rs
   - Performance implications of runtime generation
   - Maintenance implications of each approach

## Process

### Step 1: Examine Clap Documentation
- [ ] Review Clap 4.x documentation for Command and Arg APIs
- [ ] Look for methods like `get_subcommands()`, `get_arguments()`
- [ ] Check for visitor or iterator patterns
- [ ] Document available metadata fields

### Step 2: Research Existing Crates
- [ ] Investigate clap_mangen source code and approach
- [ ] Investigate clap_complete for command tree traversal
- [ ] Search for "clap documentation generation" solutions
- [ ] Look at how other CLIs handle comprehensive help

### Step 3: Prototype Exploration
- [ ] Create small test program to explore Clap introspection
- [ ] Test extracting command hierarchy
- [ ] Test extracting all available metadata
- [ ] Evaluate completeness of extractable information

### Step 4: Evaluate Build-time Generation
- [ ] Research build.rs patterns for documentation
- [ ] Consider using procedural macros
- [ ] Evaluate maintenance burden
- [ ] Consider versioning and release processes

### Step 5: Web Research
- [ ] Search for best practices in LLM-friendly CLI documentation
- [ ] Look for existing standards or schemas (e.g., OpenAPI for CLIs)
- [ ] Research how other tools expose documentation to LLMs
- [ ] Check if there are emerging standards for AI tool documentation

## Deliverables

### 1. Capabilities Report (`analysis/clap-capabilities.md`)
Document containing:
- Available Clap introspection APIs
- Extractable metadata fields
- Limitations and gaps
- Code examples of accessing command structure

### 2. Existing Solutions Analysis (`analysis/existing-solutions.md`)
- Summary of clap_mangen approach
- Summary of clap_complete approach
- Other relevant crates or patterns
- Pros/cons of each approach

### 3. Implementation Recommendation (`analysis/implementation-approach.md`)
- Recommended approach (runtime vs build-time)
- Technical architecture
- Integration points
- Risk assessment

### 4. LLM Documentation Standards (`analysis/llm-doc-standards.md`)
- Best practices for LLM-consumable documentation
- Recommended schema/format
- Examples from other tools
- Specific optimizations for token efficiency

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Examine current Shadowcat CLI structure
cd shadowcat
cargo tree | grep clap

# Look at current command definitions
rg "derive.*Parser|Subcommand|Args" --type rust

# Check Clap version and features
grep "clap" Cargo.toml

# Search for documentation examples
rg "about|long_about|help|long_help" --type rust -A 2
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Confirmed method for traversing full command tree
- [ ] Identified all extractable metadata fields
- [ ] Clear recommendation on implementation approach
- [ ] Understanding of limitations and workarounds
- [ ] Examples of similar implementations
- [ ] Prototype code demonstrating feasibility
