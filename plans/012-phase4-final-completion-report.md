## Usage Examples

### Starting Interception with Hot-Reloading
```bash
# Start with rules and auto-reload enabled
shadowcat intercept start --rules ./security-rules.json --auto-reload -- my-mcp-server

# Check status  
shadowcat intercept status

# Validate rule file
shadowcat intercept rules validate ./new-rules.yaml

# List active rules with filtering
shadowcat intercept rules list --enabled-only --format json

# Stop interception
shadowcat intercept stop
```

### Rule File Hot-Reloading
```bash
# Edit rule file - changes automatically detected and applied
vim ./security-rules.json

# Check logs to see reload confirmation
# Rules are validated before applying, with rollback on error
```

### CLI Rule Management
```bash
# Add rules from file with dry-run
shadowcat intercept rules add ./new-rules.json --dry-run

# Toggle rule status
shadowcat intercept rules toggle block-admin-delete --disable

# Show detailed rule information  
shadowcat intercept rules show block-admin-delete

# Remove rule with confirmation
shadowcat intercept rules remove old-rule-id
```
