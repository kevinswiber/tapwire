# Next Session: Test Coverage Analysis

## Context
The transport refactor is complete (Sessions 7-8). Session 7 removed the old Transport system entirely. Session 8 fixed critical resource cleanup issues that were causing programs to hang on exit. We deleted several test files during the cleanup and need to ensure all important scenarios are still tested.

## Previous Session (Session 8) Accomplishments
- ✅ Fixed StdioRawIncoming task spawning - deferred to connect() method
- ✅ Added proper shutdown mechanism to ConnectionPool with notify channel
- ✅ Replaced PooledConnection detached tasks with channel-based approach
- ✅ All examples now exit cleanly without hanging
- ✅ 788 unit tests passing, zero clippy warnings
- ✅ Updated known-issues.md - all resource cleanup issues resolved

## Objective
Analyze deleted test files to ensure we haven't lost important test coverage, and create any missing tests for the new IncomingTransport/OutgoingTransport system.

## Files Deleted (from git diff --name-only 298b72a)
```
src/transport/size_limit_tests.rs
src/transport/validation_test.rs
tests/integration_forward_proxy_sse.rs
tests/pause_resume_test.rs
tests/sse_interceptor_test.rs
tests/sse_transport_test.rs
tests/transport_regression_suite.rs
```

## Modified Test Files
```
tests/integration_api_mock.rs
tests/version_negotiation_test.rs
```

## Tasks (5 hours)

### 1. Analyze Deleted Test Coverage (1h)
For each deleted test file:
- Review what scenarios were being tested
- Document the test's purpose and importance
- Note any critical functionality that needs coverage

### 2. Map to New Architecture (2h)
- Identify where each test scenario should live in the new architecture
- Check if equivalent tests already exist for directional transports
- Create a gap analysis document

### 3. Implement Missing Tests (2h)
- Write new tests for any critical gaps identified
- Focus on:
  - Message size limits
  - Transport validation
  - SSE/streaming scenarios (if still relevant)
  - Pause/resume functionality
  - Regression scenarios

## Key Questions to Answer
1. **Size Limits**: Are message size limits still enforced in directional transports?
2. **Validation**: Is transport validation logic covered in the new system?
3. **SSE/Streaming**: Since we removed SSE transport, is streaming still supported via StreamableHttp?
4. **Pause/Resume**: Is pause/resume functionality still needed and tested?
5. **Regression Suite**: What regression scenarios need to be preserved?

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All deleted test scenarios analyzed
- [ ] Gap analysis document created
- [ ] Critical missing tests identified
- [ ] New tests written for gaps
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Note
The transport refactor and resource cleanup are functionally complete with 788 unit tests passing. This session is about ensuring we haven't lost important test coverage during the cleanup.
