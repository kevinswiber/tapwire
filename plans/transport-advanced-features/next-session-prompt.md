# Next Session: ProcessManager Integration Analysis

## Context
The transport refactor is complete with a clean directional architecture. This new plan focuses on advanced features to enhance the transport layer with better monitoring, performance, and capabilities.

## Session Objectives
Begin Phase 1 of the transport advanced features plan, focusing on ProcessManager integration for better subprocess lifecycle management.

## Tasks for This Session

### Task P.1: Analyze Current Subprocess Handling (1h)
- Review `src/transport/raw/subprocess.rs` implementation
- Review `src/transport/directional/outgoing.rs` SubprocessOutgoing
- Examine `src/process/mod.rs` ProcessManager trait
- Document current limitations and improvement opportunities

### Task P.2: Design ProcessManager Integration (1h)
- Define integration points between SubprocessOutgoing and ProcessManager
- Design monitoring capabilities (process health, resource usage)
- Plan cleanup and termination strategies
- Create design document in `analysis/process-manager-design.md`

## Key Questions to Answer
1. How does SubprocessOutgoing currently manage process lifecycle?
2. What monitoring capabilities does ProcessManager provide?
3. What are the gaps in current subprocess handling?
4. How can we integrate without breaking existing functionality?

## Deliverables
- [ ] Analysis document: `analysis/subprocess-handling-analysis.md`
- [ ] Design proposal: `analysis/process-manager-design.md`
- [ ] Updated tracker with findings
- [ ] Task files for implementation (P.3)

## Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of current subprocess handling
- Concrete design for ProcessManager integration
- No breaking changes to existing transport functionality
- Improved monitoring and cleanup capabilities

## References
- Tracker: `@plans/transport-advanced-features/transport-advanced-features-tracker.md`
- Transport refactor: `@plans/transport-refactor/transport-refactor-tracker.md`
- ProcessManager: `@shadowcat/src/process/mod.rs`
- SubprocessOutgoing: `@shadowcat/src/transport/directional/outgoing.rs`

## Time Estimate
2 hours total:
- 1h: Analysis of current implementation
- 1h: Design proposal

## Notes
- This is an enhancement, not a critical fix
- Focus on monitoring and cleanup improvements
- Consider backward compatibility
- Document any performance implications
