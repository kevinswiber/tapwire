# Transport Advanced Features Tracker

## Overview

This tracker manages advanced feature implementation for Shadowcat's transport layer, building upon the completed directional transport refactor. These features enhance monitoring, performance, and capabilities beyond the core transport functionality.

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-14  
**Total Estimated Duration**: 17 hours  
**Status**: Planning

## Goals

1. **ProcessManager Integration** - Better subprocess lifecycle management and monitoring
2. **Batch Message Support** - Handle JSON-RPC batch requests across all transports
3. **Streaming Optimizations** - Improve SSE performance and reliability
4. **Metrics & Observability** - Add transport-level metrics for monitoring

## Work Phases

### Phase 1: ProcessManager Integration (4h)
Enhance subprocess handling with proper lifecycle management and monitoring.

| ID | Task | Duration | Dependencies | Status | Owner | Notes |

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] ProcessManager properly tracks subprocess lifecycle
- [ ] Batch messages handled correctly across all transports
- [ ] SSE streaming performance improved by >20%
- [ ] Metrics available for all transport operations

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] No additional latency for non-batch messages
- [ ] SSE memory usage reduced by >15%
- [ ] Metrics collection overhead <1%

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] 95% test coverage on new code
- [ ] No clippy warnings
- [ ] Full documentation for new features
- [ ] Integration tests for all features

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| ProcessManager complexity | MEDIUM | Start with minimal integration | Planned |
| Batch message compatibility | HIGH | Extensive testing with real MCP servers | Planned |
| SSE performance regression | MEDIUM | Benchmark before/after changes | Planned |
| Metrics overhead | LOW | Use efficient collection methods | Planned |

## Session Planning Guidelines

### Next Session Prompt
See `next-session-prompt.md` in this directory for session setup.

### Optimal Session Structure
1. **Review** (5 min): Check this tracker and relevant task files
2. **Implementation** (2-3 hours): Complete the task deliverables
3. **Testing** (30 min): Run tests, fix issues
4. **Documentation** (15 min): Update tracker
5. **Handoff** (10 min): Update next-session-prompt.md
