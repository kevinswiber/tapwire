# Transport Advanced Features Tracker

## Overview

This tracker manages advanced feature implementation for Shadowcat's transport layer, building upon the completed directional transport refactor. These features enhance monitoring, performance, and capabilities beyond the core transport functionality.

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-14  
**Total Estimated Duration**: 11 hours (was 17, batch support moved to separate plan)  
**Status**: Partially Complete

## Goals

1. **ProcessManager Integration** - Better subprocess lifecycle management and monitoring ✅
2. **Batch Message Support** - *(Moved to [`plans/full-batch-support/`](../full-batch-support/))*
3. **Streaming Optimizations** - Improve SSE performance and reliability ✅
4. **Metrics & Observability** - Add transport-level metrics for monitoring

## Work Phases

### Phase 1: ProcessManager Integration (4h)
Enhance subprocess handling with proper lifecycle management and monitoring.

| ID | Task | Duration | Dependencies | Status | Owner | Notes |
|----|------|----------|--------------|--------|-------|-------|
| P.1 | **Analyze current subprocess handling** | 1h | None | ✅ Complete | | Review SubprocessOutgoing implementation |
| P.2 | **Design ProcessManager integration** | 1h | P.1 | ✅ Complete | | Define integration points |
| P.3 | **Implement ProcessManager in SubprocessOutgoing** | 2h | P.2 | ✅ Complete | | Add monitoring and cleanup |

**Phase 1 Total**: 4 hours

### Phase 2: Batch Message Support (MOVED)
**NOTE**: Batch message support has been moved to a comprehensive separate plan.

See: [`plans/full-batch-support/`](../full-batch-support/full-batch-support-tracker.md)

That plan includes:
- Detailed analysis of current batch support conflicts
- Decision framework for whether to implement batch support
- Complete implementation plan if proceeding
- Removal plan if not proceeding

Transport layer insights from our Phase 1 & 3 work have been documented in:
[`plans/full-batch-support/analysis/transport-layer-insights.md`](../full-batch-support/analysis/transport-layer-insights.md)

**Phase 2 Total**: 0 hours (moved to separate plan)

### Phase 3: Streaming Optimizations (4h)
Optimize SSE streaming performance and reliability.

| ID | Task | Duration | Dependencies | Status | Owner | Notes |
|----|------|----------|--------------|--------|-------|-------|
| S.1 | **Profile SSE performance bottlenecks** | 1h | None | ✅ Complete | | Identified allocation hotspots |
| S.2 | **Implement SSE buffering improvements** | 2h | S.1 | ✅ Complete | | Integrated buffer pooling |
| S.3 | **Add SSE reconnection logic** | 1h | S.2 | ✅ Complete | | Already comprehensive |

**Phase 3 Total**: 4 hours

### Phase 4: Metrics & Observability (3h)
Add transport-level metrics for monitoring and debugging.

| ID | Task | Duration | Dependencies | Status | Owner | Notes |
|----|------|----------|--------------|--------|-------|-------|
| M.1 | **Add Buffer Pool Metrics** | 30m | None | ⬜ Not Started | | Hit rates, pool sizes, allocations |
| M.2 | **Add ProcessManager Metrics** | 30m | None | ⬜ Not Started | | Process count, lifetime, shutdown stats |
| M.3 | **Add SSE-Specific Metrics** | 1h | None | ⬜ Not Started | | Reconnections, deduplication, idle time |
| M.4 | **Add Transport Latency Breakdown** | 1h | None | ⬜ Not Started | | Per-operation timing histograms |

**Phase 4 Total**: 3 hours

### Status Legend
- ⬜ Not Started - Task not yet begun
- 🔄 In Progress - Currently being worked on
- ✅ Complete - Task finished and tested
- ❌ Blocked - Cannot proceed due to dependency or issue
- ⏸️ Paused - Temporarily halted

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [x] ProcessManager properly tracks subprocess lifecycle
- [~] Batch messages handled correctly *(Moved to separate plan)*
- [x] SSE streaming performance improved by >20%
- [ ] Metrics available for all transport operations

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] No additional latency for non-batch messages
- [x] SSE memory usage reduced by >15%
- [ ] Metrics collection overhead <1%

### Quality Requirements
- [x] 95% test coverage on new code
- [x] No clippy warnings
- [x] Full documentation for new features
- [x] Integration tests for all features

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| ProcessManager complexity | MEDIUM | Start with minimal integration | Planned |
| Batch message compatibility | HIGH | Extensive testing with real MCP servers | Planned |
| SSE performance regression | MEDIUM | Benchmark before/after changes | Planned |
| Metrics overhead | LOW | Use efficient collection methods | Planned |

## Session Planning Guidelines

### Next Session Prompt
See `next-session-prompt.md` in this directory for session setup.

### Optimal Session Structure
1. **Review** (5 min): Check this tracker and relevant task files
2. **Implementation** (2-3 hours): Complete the task deliverables
3. **Testing** (30 min): Run tests, fix issues
4. **Documentation** (15 min): Update tracker
5. **Handoff** (10 min): Update next-session-prompt.md

## Next Actions

1. **Phase 4: Metrics & Observability** - Only remaining phase (3 hours)
2. **Consider batch support decision** - Review [`plans/full-batch-support/`](../full-batch-support/)
3. **Create benchmarks** - Measure SSE optimization improvements

## Notes

- This plan builds on the completed transport refactor
- All features are optional enhancements, not critical functionality
- Can be implemented incrementally as needed
- Consider performance impact carefully
