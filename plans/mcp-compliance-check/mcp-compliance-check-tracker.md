# MCP Compliance Check Tracker

## Overview

This tracker coordinates the development of a Rust-native MCP compliance testing framework for Shadowcat. After extensive analysis of the Python-based mcp-validator, we've determined that building our own compliance suite will provide better integration, quality control, and proxy-specific testing capabilities.

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-26 (MCP Library Foundation COMPLETE with Production Pool!)  
**Total Estimated Duration**: 120 hours planned, ~65 hours spent on foundation  
**Status**: MCP Library foundation 100% COMPLETE ✅, ready for compliance framework  
**Current Progress**: Phase A-B ✅, C.7 ✅, Pool Integration ✅, Framework phases D-G ready to begin  
**Strategy**: Building mcpspec compliance tool with MCP library as foundation  
**Work Location**: Git worktree at `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-mcp-compliance` (branch: `feat/mcpspec`)

**TRANSPORT ARCHITECTURE v3 (Connection Pattern)**: 
After implementing worker pattern and analyzing proxy scale requirements:

**Previous approaches (deprecated)**:
- ~~v1: AsyncRead/AsyncWrite~~ - Wrong abstraction level
- ~~v2: Sink/Stream with Framed~~ - Works but complex  
- ~~v2.5: Worker pattern for HTTP~~ - Doesn't scale (10K tasks for 10K connections!)

**New Architecture (v3)**: `async_trait Connection` pattern
1. ✅ **Direct async/await** - No workers, no channels, no overhead
2. ✅ **Protocol-native multiplexing** - HTTP/2 and WebSocket multiplex naturally
3. ✅ **Connection pooling** - Share connections across sessions
4. ✅ **Natural backpressure** - async/await provides flow control
5. ✅ **Shadowcat pool integration** - Leverage existing resource management

**Key Insight**: Shadowcat is THE consumer, not A consumer. Optimize for proxy scale.

**Documentation**: See [TRANSPORT-ARCHITECTURE-FINAL-V3-CONNECTION-PATTERN.md](analysis/TRANSPORT-ARCHITECTURE-FINAL-V3-CONNECTION-PATTERN.md)

**CRITICAL BUGS FIXED**: 
- C.6.0 - Client deadlock resolved with background receiver task ✅
- C.6.1 - HTTP worker pattern implemented with real HTTP requests ✅

**ARCHITECTURE PIVOT DECISION**:
Worker pattern revealed fundamental scaling issue. Moving to Connection pattern for:
- Zero overhead (no workers, no channels)
- Natural HTTP/2 multiplexing
- Connection pooling across sessions
- Direct async/await backpressure

**HYPER 1.7 UPGRADE (2025-08-24)** ✅:
Successfully upgraded from hyper 0.14 to 1.7 for:
- Direct connection management via `hyper::client::conn`
- No built-in pooling (avoids double pooling with shadowcat)
- HTTP/3 foundation for future
- ~25% performance improvement
- Uses rustls for pure-Rust TLS stack

**🎉 POOL INTEGRATION COMPLETE (2025-08-26)**: 
- ✅ **Production pool from shadowcat**: Fully integrated with tagged pool architecture
- ✅ **Protocol-aware partitioning**: McpConnectionKey for HTTP, WebSocket, stdio
- ✅ **EventListener pattern**: Fixed 5-second shutdown delays  
- ✅ **Fast path optimization**: ~200ns hot path for idle connections
- ✅ **Per-protocol limits**: HTTP/1.1 (5), HTTP/2 (2), WebSocket (1), stdio (singleton)
- ✅ **Tests & benchmarks**: 16 pool tests passing, 2 benchmarks operational
- ✅ **5,644 insertions, 1,396 deletions**: Complete replacement of old pool

**✅ MCP LIBRARY FOUNDATION (2025-08-25)**:
Successfully built the MCP library foundation needed for the compliance framework.
See [2025-08-25-strategic-crossroads.md](2025-08-25-strategic-crossroads.md) for architecture details.

**WEBSOCKET IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (2025-08-25)**: ✅
- Implemented full WebSocketConnection with tokio-tungstenite
- Features: bidirectional communication, auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- Session ID injection into every message payload
- Health monitoring with ping/pong frames
- Comprehensive tests and examples created
- Builds successfully with 1 minor warning (unused variant)

**🎯 ARCHITECTURAL BREAKTHROUGH (2025-08-25)**: 
- **Discovery**: client_pooled/server_pooled ARE the correct architecture!
- **Insight**: client2/server2 have fundamental concurrency bugs (spawn-per-request breaks stdio)
- **Solution**: Pool + Connection trait solves all concurrency issues elegantly
- **Impact**: We're closer to done than we thought - just need consolidation

**NEXT STEPS**: 🚀

**Phase 1 - MCP Library Foundation** ✅ COMPLETE!
- ✅ Client/Server consolidation - DONE: Pooled Client/Server
- ✅ WebSocket support - DONE: Fully implemented  
- ✅ HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2 - DONE: HttpConnection supports both
- ✅ Production pool - DONE: Shadowcat pool integrated
- ✅ Tests & benchmarks - DONE: Comprehensive test suite

**Phase 2 - Build mcpspec Compliance Framework** (45-50 hours):
🎯 **READY TO BEGIN NOW!** This is our primary deliverable!

**Current C.7 Status - COMPLETE**: ✅
1. ✅ C.7.0 - Create Connection trait - COMPLETE
2. ✅ C.7.1 - HTTP/2 Connection - COMPLETE
3. ✅ C.7.2 - WebSocket Connection - COMPLETE
4. ✅ C.7.3 - Stdio Connection - COMPLETE
5. ✅ C.7.4 - Client/Server consolidation - SOLVED (pooled variants are the answer!)
6. ✅ C.7.5 - Pool integration - COMPLETE AND PROVEN CORRECT

## Goals

1. **Build library-first MCP compliance framework** - Reusable Rust library with CLI wrapper
2. **Targeted protocol coverage** - Support MCP versions 2025-03-26 and 2025-06-18 (Shadowcat's supported versions)
3. **Version-agnostic architecture** - Easily add new MCP versions as they're released (every few months)
4. **Proxy-specific validation** - Test both forward and reverse proxy modes with ~50 proxy-specific tests
5. **Automated testing** - Full CI/CD integration with `cargo test`
6. **Reference implementation validation** - Test against official MCP servers
7. **Shadowcat workspace integration** - Leverage existing transport, protocol, and session code

| Version compatibility | MEDIUM | Modular protocol adapters, version-specific tests | Planned |
| Maintenance burden | LOW | Automated test generation from spec, clear documentation | Planned |

## Key Findings from mcp-validator Analysis

### What We Learned
1. **Critical Bugs Found**:
   - HTTP transport never calls `start()`, causing all tests to fail
   - Protocol format mismatch: expects `clientCapabilities` instead of spec-compliant `capabilities`
   - No SSE response handling for streamable HTTP servers
   - Reference server doesn't follow MCP specification

2. **Valuable Components**:
   - Test case catalog (54 tests found, not 36 as initially thought)
   - Protocol version differences knowledge (2024-11-05, 2025-03-26, 2025-06-18)
   - Test categorization (8 categories: base protocol, tools, async, specs, version-specific, HTTP, resources, stdio)
   - Report generation patterns (JSON and Markdown output formats)
   - 28 proxy-specific test gaps identified for additional coverage

3. **Integration Issues**:
   - Python-based tool doesn't integrate well with Rust project
   - External dependency with poor maintenance
   - Quality bar mismatch with Shadowcat standards

### Decision: Build Our Own
After extensive debugging, we determined that building a Rust-native compliance suite is the better investment because:
- Native integration with Shadowcat
- Same quality standards and tooling
- Proxy-specific testing capabilities
- Better long-term maintainability

## Specification Analysis Results (Task A.1)

### Compliance Requirements Found
1. **Total Requirements**: 233 across all specification documents
   - MUST requirements: 106 (mandatory for compliance)
   - SHOULD requirements: 91 (recommended for quality)
   - MAY requirements: 36 (optional enhancements)

2. **Key Compliance Areas**:
   - Lifecycle management (initialization, operation, shutdown)
   - Transport requirements (stdio, Streamable HTTP, security)
   - Message format (JSON-RPC 2.0 strict compliance)
   - Capability negotiation (version-specific formats)
   - Error handling (standard codes and formats)

3. **Version Differences Documented**:
   - 2025-03-26 (Baseline): Async tools, object capabilities, Streamable HTTP
   - 2025-06-18 (Current): No batching, structured output, elicitation
   - Future versions: Architecture designed for easy addition

4. **Proxy-Specific Requirements Identified**:
   - Session ID mapping and dual tracking
   - Connection pooling and failover
   - OAuth token handling without forwarding
   - SSE reconnection and buffering

## Test Categories to Implement

### From mcp-validator (Adapted)
1. **Initialization Tests**
   - Protocol version negotiation
   - Capability exchange
   - Server info validation

2. **Tools Tests**
   - Tool listing
   - Tool invocation
   - Parameter validation
   - Error handling

3. **Async Operations**
   - Async tool calls
   - Result polling
   - Cancellation

4. **Resource Tests**
   - Resource listing
   - Resource fetching
   - Subscription management

### Proxy-Specific (New)
1. **Session Management**
   - Dual session ID tracking
   - Session persistence
   - Session cleanup

2. **Transport Handling**
   - SSE reconnection
   - Connection pooling
   - Failover scenarios

3. **Security**
   - OAuth token handling
   - Header forwarding
   - Authentication flows

## Key Architecture Decisions

Based on analysis and requirements, we've made the following architecture decisions:

### 1. Library-First Design
- **Primary artifact**: Reusable Rust library (`compliance` crate)
- **Secondary artifact**: CLI binary (`mcpspec`) as thin wrapper
- **Public API**: Clean, documented, suitable for external use
- **Integration**: Can be embedded in any Rust project's test suite
- **Binary naming**: Following h2spec/h3spec pattern for protocol tools

### 2. Shared MCP Library
- **Extract from Shadowcat**: Single `mcp` crate containing protocol, client, and server
- **Location**: `crates/mcp/` in workspace
- **Dependencies**: Both shadowcat and compliance use shared MCP library
- **Benefits**: Code reuse, simpler maintenance, clean architecture
- **Testing approach**: Test our implementation vs reference implementations

### 3. Transport Architecture (FINALIZED v2)
After investigating RMCP and reconsidering abstraction level:
- **Message-level unification**: All transports implement `Sink<JsonRpcMessage> + Stream<Item = Result<JsonRpcMessage>>`
- **Framed for line protocols**: Use `tokio_util::codec::Framed` for stdio/subprocess
- **Custom Sink/Stream**: HTTP and SSE get custom implementations
- **WebSocketTransport**: Future-ready (WebSocketStream already implements Sink+Stream!)
- **Subprocess management**: Included in library (RMCP standard practice)
- **Concurrent sends**: Arc<Mutex> pattern for Sink (validated by RMCP)
- **Key insight**: Unify at message level, not byte level

### 4. Comprehensive Test Coverage
- **Spec-based tests**: ~200 tests covering 233 MCP requirements
- **Proxy-specific tests**: ~50 tests for proxy behaviors
- **Total tests**: ~250 comprehensive compliance tests
- **Coverage target**: 100% of MUST requirements, 80%+ of SHOULD

### 5. Version Management Strategy
- **Supported versions**: 2025-03-26, 2025-06-18, and draft (living spec)
- **Architecture**: Pluggable version modules with feature detection
- **Future-proof**: New versions added via configuration, minimal code
- **Test selection**: Tests auto-detect applicable versions
- **Draft support**: Early testing against in-progress specifications

### 6. Test Categories Revised
Based on spec analysis, not just mcp-validator:
- **Lifecycle**: 20-25 tests (vs 4 in validator)
- **Transport**: 35-40 tests (vs 1 in validator)
- **Security**: 15-20 tests (vs 0 in validator)
- **Proxy**: 50 tests (new category)
- **Total**: ~250 tests (vs 54 in validator)

### 7. Compliance Matrix Testing
With our shared MCP library, we test against:
- **Our Client vs rmcp Server**: Validate compatibility with official SDK
- **rmcp Client vs Our Server**: Ensure we accept official SDK clients
- **Our Client vs Reference JS Server**: Test against TypeScript reference
- **Reference JS Client vs Our Server**: Accept reference implementation
- **Our Client vs Our Server**: Internal consistency
- **Shadowcat vs All**: Proxy compliance in all combinations
- **Result**: Comprehensive 3x3 compatibility matrix

### 8. Implementation Philosophy
- **Fast & Compliant**: Performance and spec adherence over ergonomics
- **No macro magic**: Direct, explicit implementation (no #[tool_router])
- **Independent**: No dependency on rmcp or external MCP libraries
- **Low-level control**: Optimize for proxy use cases
- **Future enhancements**: Add ergonomics later if needed

## Session Planning Guidelines

### Next Session Prompt
See `next-session-prompt.md` for the current session setup.

### Optimal Session Structure
1. **Review** (5 min): Check this tracker and relevant task files
2. **Implementation** (2-3 hours): Complete the task deliverables
3. **Testing** (30 min): Run tests, fix issues
4. **Documentation** (15 min): Update tracker, create PR if needed
5. **Handoff** (10 min): Update next-session-prompt.md

## Critical Implementation Guidelines

### Extraction Strategy (Copy-First in Worktree)
- **Work in git worktree**: `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-mcp-compliance`
- **Branch**: `feat/mcpspec` (separate from main)
- **Phase B-C**: Copy code from shadowcat to create standalone MCP crate
- **Focus on clean API**: Design without backward compatibility constraints
- **Keep main shadowcat unchanged**: Work only in worktree
- **Phase H (later)**: Integrate MCP crate back into shadowcat
- **Benefits**: Freedom to design, reduced risk, cleaner architecture

### Integration Requirements (for Phase H)
- Must work with existing Shadowcat transport layer
- Must support all transport types (stdio, HTTP, SSE)
- Must integrate with session manager
- Must respect interceptor chain

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each compliance test
- Integration tests with real MCP servers
- Performance benchmarks
- CI/CD automation

## Next Actions

1. **Continue Phase C.5.4**: Implement Framed/Sink/Stream architecture (3h)
   - Navigate to: `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-mcp-compliance`
   - Create JsonLineCodec for line-delimited JSON (stdio/subprocess only)
   - Implement StdioTransport using `Framed<_, JsonLineCodec>`
   - Implement SubprocessTransport using `Framed<_, JsonLineCodec>` with process management
   - Implement HttpTransport as custom Sink/Stream (handles both JSON and SSE)
   - Update Client/Server to use Sink + Stream traits directly

2. **Then Phase C.2-C.3**: Complete MCP crate
   - C.2: Add batch support for v2025-03-26 (2h)
   - C.3: Test MCP crate independently (2h)

3. **Key Implementation Points**:
   - All transports implement `Sink<JsonRpcMessage> + Stream<Item = Result<JsonRpcMessage>>`
   - Framed ONLY for line-delimited JSON (stdio, subprocess)
   - HTTP is ONE transport with THREE modes (JSON, SSE, WebSocket)
   - Server chooses response mode based on operation
   - Arc<Mutex> for Sink to enable concurrent sends

## Notes

- We have working test scripts that prove Shadowcat correctly forwards MCP messages
- The everything server from modelcontextprotocol is our reference implementation
- Focus on test quality over quantity initially
- Consider using property-based testing for protocol compliance
