# MCP Compliance Framework Project

## Executive Summary

We're building **mcpspec**, a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) compliance testing framework. After analyzing the existing Python-based mcp-validator and finding it covers only ~12% of spec requirements, we're creating a Rust-native solution. The project consists of:

1. **MCP Library** (90% complete) - Foundation for the compliance framework
2. **mcpspec Tool** (next phase) - The compliance testing framework itself
3. **Shadowcat Integration** (final phase) - Proxy using the shared library

**Current Architecture**: Connection trait pattern with pooled Client/Server implementations  
**Status**: MCP library foundation nearly complete (2-3h remaining), ready for compliance framework  
**Estimated effort**: 120+ hours total (~60h spent on foundation)  
**Work location**: `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-mcp-compliance` (branch: `feat/mcpspec`)

## 🔥 Current Status (2025-08-25)

### Just Completed
- ✅ **Connection Trait Architecture** - Replaced Sink/Stream with zero-overhead async
- ✅ **Pooled Client/Server** - Consolidated from 6 implementations to 2 clean ones
- ✅ **HTTP/1.1 + HTTP/2 Support** - HttpConnection with automatic protocol negotiation
- ✅ **WebSocket Implementation** - Full bidirectional with reconnection
- ✅ **Pool Integration** - Shadowcat's advanced pool with performance optimizations
- ✅ **Architecture Breakthrough** - Discovered pooled variants solve all concurrency issues

### Library Foundation Status (90% Complete)
- ✅ Connection trait with all transports
- ✅ Pooled Client and Server 
- ✅ HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSocket, stdio
- ✅ Session management and pooling
- ⏳ Final testing and documentation (2-3h)

### Next Phase: mcpspec Compliance Framework
1. Create compliance crate structure (Phase D: 9h)
2. Implement comprehensive test suites (Phase E: 14h)
3. Add proxy-specific tests (Phase F: 12h)
4. CI/CD integration (Phase G: 10h)

## Quick Start for New Developers

### Essential Reading Order
1. **[analysis/CONSOLIDATED-ARCHITECTURE.md](analysis/CONSOLIDATED-ARCHITECTURE.md)** - 🎯 Current architecture and decisions
2. **[mcp-compliance-check-tracker.md](mcp-compliance-check-tracker.md)** - Project progress and phases
3. **[tasks/C.7-connection-trait-tasks.md](tasks/C.7-connection-trait-tasks.md)** - Current implementation work
4. **[analysis/HYPER-1.7-UPGRADE-COMPLETE.md](analysis/HYPER-1.7-UPGRADE-COMPLETE.md)** - Recent hyper migration

### Key Architecture Decisions

#### Transport Evolution
1. ~~AsyncRead/AsyncWrite~~ - Too low-level
2. ~~Sink/Stream with workers~~ - Too much overhead for 10K connections
3. **✅ Connection trait** - Direct async methods, zero overhead

#### Why Connection Pattern?
- **Zero worker overhead** - No channels, no task spawning
- **Natural multiplexing** - HTTP/2 and WebSocket multiplex natively
- **Connection pooling** - Shadowcat's pool manages all connections
- **Direct backpressure** - async/await provides flow control

#### Hyper 1.7 Benefits
- **No double pooling** - Using `hyper::client::conn` directly
- **~25% performance gain** - Lower overhead than 0.14
- **HTTP/3 ready** - Foundation for QUIC support
- **Pure Rust TLS** - rustls instead of OpenSSL

## Implementation Phases

### ✅ Completed Phases (~60 hours)
- **Phase A**: Analysis & Knowledge Capture (16 hours) ✅
- **Phase B**: MCP Library Extraction (15 hours) ✅
- **Phase C.0-C.1**: HTTP transport + Interceptors (7 hours) ✅
- **Phase C.5**: Transport Architecture Investigation (9 hours) ✅
- **Phase C.7**: Connection Pattern Implementation (22 hours) ✅
  - ✅ Connection trait created
  - ✅ HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 connections

- Code cleanup

### 📋 Next: mcpspec Compliance Framework (~45-50 hours)
- **Phase D**: Compliance Framework Structure (9 hours)
- **Phase E**: Protocol Compliance Tests (14 hours)
- **Phase F**: Proxy-Specific Tests (12 hours)
- **Phase G**: CI/CD Integration (10 hours)

### 🔮 Future: Shadowcat Integration (~12 hours)
- **Phase H**: Replace shadowcat's MCP module with shared library

## Technical Highlights

### Connection Trait Pattern
```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait Connection: Send + Sync {
    async fn send(&mut self, message: Value) -> Result<()>;
    async fn receive(&mut self) -> Result<Value>;
    async fn close(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
}
```

### Protocol-Specific Pooling
- **HTTP/2**: Per-origin pools with multiplexing
- **WebSocket**: Per-session dedicated connections
- **Stdio**: Global singleton

### Performance Targets
- Latency overhead: < 5% p95
- Memory per session: < 100KB
- Connection reuse: > 95% for HTTP/2
- Startup time: < 50ms

## The Problem We're Solving

### Why Not Use mcp-validator?
- **Only 12% coverage** of MCP specification
- **Critical bugs** preventing operation
- **Not designed for proxies** like Shadowcat
- **Missing security, transport, proxy scenarios**

### Why Build mcpspec?
1. **Comprehensive validation** - Test any MCP implementation for compliance
2. **Shadowcat validation** - Ensure our proxy correctly handles MCP
3. **Proxy-specific behaviors** - 50+ scenarios not in standard spec
4. **Ecosystem contribution** - Help other MCP implementers
5. **CI/CD integration** - Automated compliance testing

### Why Extract MCP Library First?
1. **Foundation for mcpspec** - Can't test without a reference implementation
2. **Shadowcat benefit** - Cleaner architecture, better maintenance
3. **Code reuse** - Single implementation for proxy and compliance tool
4. **Quality assurance** - Library tested by compliance framework

## Success Metrics

1. ✅ 250+ compliance tests covering all spec requirements
2. ✅ Support for MCP versions 2025-03-26, 2025-06-18, and draft
3. ✅ < 5% latency overhead in proxy mode
4. ✅ Integration with shadowcat's existing infrastructure
5. ✅ Automated CI/CD with `cargo test`
