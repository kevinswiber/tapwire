# Task A.1: Analyze MCP Spec Compliance Points

## Objective

Analyze the official MCP specifications to identify all compliance requirements, creating a comprehensive checklist for our Rust implementation to ensure full protocol compliance.

## Background

The MCP specifications define the protocol requirements across multiple versions. We need to:
- Identify all MUST/SHOULD/MAY requirements
- Document version-specific differences
- Create testable compliance points
- Map specifications to test scenarios

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What are the mandatory (MUST) requirements for MCP compliance?
2. How do requirements differ between protocol versions?
3. What are the critical paths that must be tested?
4. Which optional features should we support?

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Specification Review (1 hour)

Navigate and review MCP specifications:

```bash
# Navigate to specs
cd ~/src/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/docs/specification

# List available versions
ls -la

# Key files to review per version
find . -name "*.mdx" -o -name "*.md" | grep -E "(lifecycle|transport|protocol)" | head -20
```

Focus areas:
- `basic/lifecycle.mdx` - Connection lifecycle requirements
- `basic/transports.mdx` - Transport-specific requirements
- `basic/protocol.mdx` - Core protocol rules
- `server/` - Server-side requirements
- `client/` - Client-side requirements

### 2. Requirement Extraction (1 hour)

#### 2.1 Lifecycle Requirements

From `2025-03-26/basic/lifecycle.mdx`:
- Initialization sequence
- Capability negotiation
- Shutdown procedures

#### 2.2 Protocol Requirements

Core JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance:
- Request/response format
- Batch operations
- Error codes

#### 2.3 Transport Requirements

Transport-specific rules:
- HTTP headers
- SSE format
- stdio framing

### 3. Compliance Checklist Creation (30 min)

Create `analysis/mcp-compliance-checklist.md`:

```markdown
# MCP Compliance Checklist

## Mandatory Requirements (MUST)

### Lifecycle
- [ ] Client MUST send initialize before other requests
- [ ] Server MUST respond with capabilities
- [ ] Client MUST send initialized notification
...

### Protocol
- [ ] MUST use JSON-RPC 2.0 format
- [ ] MUST include jsonrpc: "2.0" field
...

## Recommended Requirements (SHOULD)

### Error Handling
- [ ] SHOULD use standard error codes
- [ ] SHOULD include error data
...
```

### 4. Version Comparison (30 min)

Document version differences:

```markdown
## Version Differences

### 2024-11-05 → 2025-03-26
- Added: Async tool operations
- Changed: Capability format (boolean → object)
- Added: New error codes

### 2025-03-26 → 2025-06-18
- Added: Extended capabilities
- Required: MCP-Protocol-Version header
- Changed: Tool schema format
```

## Expected Deliverables

### New Files
- `analysis/mcp-compliance-checklist.md` - Categorized compliance requirements
- `analysis/protocol-version-matrix.md` - Version comparison table

### Modified Files
- `analysis/README.md` - Update with compliance findings

### Documentation Format

```markdown
# Compliance Requirement Template

## Requirement: {Brief Description}
**Specification**: {Section reference}
**Level**: MUST | SHOULD | MAY
**Versions**: {Applicable versions}

**Description**:
{Full requirement text from spec}

**Test Approach**:
{How we'll validate this requirement}

**Implementation Notes**:
{Rust-specific considerations}
```

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [x] All MUST requirements identified (106 found)
- [x] All SHOULD requirements documented (91 found)
- [x] Version differences mapped
- [x] Test approaches defined
- [x] Compliance checklist created
- [x] Version matrix completed (2024-11-05, 2025-03-26, 2025-06-18)
- [x] Proxy-specific requirements noted
- [x] Tracker updated

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | 
|------|--------|------------|
| Spec ambiguity | MEDIUM | Test against reference implementation |
| Missing specifications | LOW | Refer to TypeScript SDK |
| Version conflicts | MEDIUM | Clearly document version-specific behavior |

## Duration Estimate

**Total: 3 hours**
- Specification review: 1 hour
- Requirement extraction: 1 hour
- Checklist creation: 30 minutes
- Version comparison: 30 minutes

## Dependencies

- Task A.0 provides context on what tests exist

## Integration Points

- **Test Implementation**: Each requirement needs test coverage
- **Protocol Adapters**: Version-specific requirements guide adapter design
- **Documentation**: Compliance status in reports

## Specification Locations

```bash
# Main specification directory
~/src/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/specs/

# Version directories

# Key specification files

## Example Compliance Documentation

```markdown
## Requirement: Initialize Before Operations

**Specification**: 2025-03-26/basic/lifecycle.mdx#initialization
**Level**: MUST
**Versions**: All

**Description**:
"The client MUST initiate this phase by sending an initialize request before any other requests except pings."

**Test Approach**:
1. Send non-initialize request before initialize
2. Verify error response
3. Send initialize request
4. Verify subsequent requests succeed

**Implementation Notes**:
- Enforce in both forward and reverse proxy
- Track initialization state in session
- Return appropriate error for violations

**Related Tests**:
- test_initialization_required
- test_premature_request_rejection
```

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Working directory
cd ~/src/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/specs

# Find all requirement keywords
grep -r "MUST\|SHOULD\|MAY" . --include="*.mdx" | wc -l

# Extract MUST requirements
grep -r "MUST" 2025-03-26/ --include="*.mdx" | sed 's/.*: *//' | sort -u

# Compare versions
diff -r 2024-11-05/ 2025-03-26/ --include="*.mdx" | head -50

# Find transport-specific requirements
grep -r "transport" 2025-03-26/ --include="*.mdx" -A 2 -B 2
```

## Follow-up Tasks

After completing this task:
