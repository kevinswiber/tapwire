# Interceptor Stream Optimization Tracker

## Overview

Optimize Shadowcat's interceptor architecture to address performance issues with SSE stream processing while maintaining transport-agnostic design. Based on research conducted during H.5 SSE reconnection implementation.

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-20  
**Total Estimated Duration**: 20-30 hours  
**Status**: Planning

## Goals

1. **Eliminate SSE Performance Bottleneck** - Reduce from 50-100μs per event to <5μs
2. **Maintain Transport Agnosticism** - Keep interceptors protocol-focused, not transport-aware
3. **Enable Batch Processing** - Support efficient batch operations for streaming
4. **Preserve Backward Compatibility** - Existing interceptor API should continue working

## Architecture Vision

```
Current (Performance Problem):
SSE Stream → Parse Events → Individual Async Interceptors → Re-stream
              (50-100μs per event overhead!)

Target Architecture:
SSE Stream → Batch Buffer → Batch Interceptors → Stream Output
              (<5μs per event with batching)
```

- ⏸️ Paused - Temporarily halted

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Existing interceptors continue working
- ✅ New batch API supports all interceptor operations
- ✅ SSE reconnection remains functional

### Performance Requirements
- ✅ < 5μs per SSE event processing time
- ✅ < 100MB memory for 10,000 events/sec
- ✅ 70% reduction in CPU usage for streaming

### Quality Requirements
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ No clippy warnings
- ✅ Benchmark suite demonstrates improvements
- ✅ Migration guide for batch API

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| Breaking existing interceptors | HIGH | Adapter pattern for backward compatibility | Planned |
| Sync requirement issues resurface | MEDIUM | Keep reconnect_simple.rs as fallback | Active |
| Batch processing adds latency | MEDIUM | Configurable batch sizes and timeouts | Planned |
| Memory growth from buffering | LOW | Bounded buffers with backpressure | Planned |

- [H.5 Task](../refactor-legacy-reverse-proxy/tasks/phase-h-fixes/H.4-implement-sse-reconnection.md) - SSE reconnection implementation

### Key Findings from Research
1. **Root Cause**: Processing SSE streams as individual events with async overhead
2. **Performance Impact**: 50-100μs per event, 60% CPU at 10k events/sec
3. **Solution**: Batch processing at transport layer, keep interceptors protocol-focused
4. **Architecture**: 2 MCP transports (stdio, Streamable HTTP), not 3

## Next Actions

1. **Review existing research documents**
2. **Design batch processing API**
3. **Create proof-of-concept implementation**
4. **Benchmark improvements**

## Notes

- This plan emerged from Session 11 of refactor-legacy-reverse-proxy
- The `reconnect_simple.rs` workaround should be replaced once optimization is complete
- Focus on SSE performance first, then consider stdio optimizations
- Keep interceptors transport-agnostic per user guidance
