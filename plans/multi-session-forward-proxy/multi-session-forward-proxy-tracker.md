# Multi-Session Forward Proxy - Implementation Tracker

## Project Status
**Status**: ðŸ”µ Planning  
**Started**: 2025-01-15  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-15

## Context
The forward proxy currently handles only one client-server connection at a time. This enhancement will enable it to accept multiple concurrent client connections, spawning independent upstream connections for each.

## Phases

### Phase A: Research & Analysis (2-3 hours)
Understand current limitations and design multi-session architecture.

| Task | Status | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| A.0 Analyze current forward proxy implementation | â¬œ Not Started | 1h | Understand single-session limitations |
| A.1 Research connection pooling strategies | â¬œ Not Started | 0.5h | For HTTP transport optimization |
| A.2 Design multi-session architecture | â¬œ Not Started | 1h | Connection management strategy |
| A.3 Plan resource management | â¬œ Not Started | 0.5h | Memory, file descriptors, threads |

### Phase B: Core Implementation (6-8 hours)
Implement multi-session support with proper isolation.

| Task | Status | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| B.0 Refactor ForwardProxy struct | â¬œ Not Started | 1.5h | Support multiple sessions |
| B.1 Implement connection accept loop | â¬œ Not Started | 2h | Handle multiple clients |
| B.2 Add session registry | â¬œ Not Started | 1.5h | Track active connections |
| B.3 Implement per-client task spawning | â¬œ Not Started | 2h | Isolate client-server pairs |
| B.4 Add graceful shutdown | â¬œ Not Started | 1h | Clean termination of all sessions |

### Phase C: Transport-Specific Features (2-3 hours)
Handle transport-specific optimizations and edge cases.

| Task | Status | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| C.0 HTTP connection pooling | â¬œ Not Started | 1.5h | Reuse upstream connections |
| C.1 Stdio multiplexing strategy | â¬œ Not Started | 1h | Handle stdio limitations |
| C.2 SSE session management | â¬œ Not Started | 0.5h | Long-lived connections |

### Phase D: Testing & Documentation (3-4 hours)
Ensure robustness and document the new architecture.

| Task | Status | Effort | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| D.0 Unit tests for multi-session | â¬œ Not Started | 1h | Test session isolation |
| D.1 Integration tests with multiple clients | â¬œ Not Started | 1.5h | End-to-end testing |
| D.2 Load testing | â¬œ Not Started | 1h | Performance validation |
| D.3 Update documentation | â¬œ Not Started | 0.5h | Architecture and usage docs |

## Key Decisions
- **Decision**: Keep single-session mode as option for backward compatibility
- **Decision**: Use tokio tasks for per-client isolation
- **Decision**: Implement session limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Decision**: HTTP connections can potentially be pooled
- **Decision**: Stdio transport remains single-connection (OS limitation)

## Technical Notes

### Current Architecture (Single Session)
```rust
pub struct ForwardProxy {
    session_id: SessionId,  // Single session
    // ...
}

// Blocking loop for single client
loop {
    let request = client.receive_request().await?;
    server.send_request(request).await?;
    let response = server.receive_response().await?;
    client.send_response(response).await?;
}
```

### Proposed Architecture (Multi-Session)
```rust
pub struct ForwardProxy {
    sessions: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<SessionId, SessionState>>>,
    max_sessions: usize,
    // ...
}

// Accept loop spawning handlers
loop {
    let (client_transport, session_id) = accept_client().await?;
    let server_transport = create_upstream().await?;
    
    tokio::spawn(handle_session(
        session_id,
        client_transport,
        server_transport,
        sessions.clone()
    ));
}
```

### Resource Management
- **Max Sessions**: Configurable limit (default: 1000)
- **Per-Session Memory**: ~100KB estimated
- **File Descriptors**: 2 per session (client + server)
- **Tasks**: 2-3 tokio tasks per session

### Transport Considerations

#### HTTP/SSE
- Can accept multiple connections on same port
- Connection pooling possible for upstream
- SSE needs special handling for long-lived streams

#### Stdio
- Fundamentally single-connection
- Could multiplex with protocol-level sessions
- Or keep as single-session only

## Blockers & Issues
- Stdio transport may not support true multi-session
- Need to decide on connection pooling strategy
- Resource limits need careful tuning

## Next Steps
1. Analyze current ForwardProxy implementation
2. Design session registry and lifecycle
3. Prototype accept loop with task spawning
