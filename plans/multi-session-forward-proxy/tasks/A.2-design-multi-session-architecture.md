# Task A.2: Design Multi-Session Architecture

## Objective
Design a robust architecture for the forward proxy that can handle multiple concurrent client connections with proper isolation and resource management.

## Key Questions
1. How to structure the session registry?
2. How to manage transport lifecycles?
3. How to handle resource limits?
4. How to implement graceful shutdown?
5. Should we keep single-session mode?

## Process

### 1. Core Architecture Design
- [ ] Session registry structure
- [ ] Connection accept loop design
- [ ] Task spawning strategy
- [ ] State management approach

### 2. Session Lifecycle
- [ ] Session creation flow
- [ ] Session state tracking
- [ ] Session termination
- [ ] Resource cleanup

### 3. Concurrency Model
- [ ] Task per session vs shared tasks
- [ ] Lock strategy for shared state
- [ ] Message passing vs shared memory
- [ ] Backpressure handling

### 4. Resource Management
- [ ] Maximum session limits
- [ ] Memory per session
- [ ] File descriptor limits
- [ ] Task/thread limits
- [ ] Rate limiting per session

### 5. Error Handling
- [ ] Session isolation on errors
- [ ] Partial failure handling
- [ ] Recovery strategies
- [ ] Logging and debugging

### 6. Configuration
- [ ] Multi-session enable/disable
- [ ] Session limits configuration
- [ ] Timeout settings
- [ ] Transport-specific options

## Deliverables
Create `analysis/multi-session-architecture.md` with:
1. Architecture diagrams
2. Component interaction flows
3. State management design
4. Resource management strategy
5. Configuration schema

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete architecture documented
- [ ] All edge cases considered
- [ ] Resource limits defined
- [ ] Implementation path clear
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
