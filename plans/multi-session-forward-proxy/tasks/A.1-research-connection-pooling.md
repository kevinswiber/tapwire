# Task A.1: Research Connection Pooling Strategies

## Objective
Determine if and how connection pooling can be implemented for the forward proxy, particularly for HTTP transports where multiple clients might connect to the same upstream server.

## Key Questions
1. When can connections be safely reused?
2. How does MCP session state affect pooling?
3. What are the security implications?
4. How do other proxies handle this?
5. Is pooling worth the complexity?

## Process

### 1. MCP Protocol Analysis
- [ ] Review MCP session semantics
- [ ] Understand initialization/shutdown flow
- [ ] Identify session-specific state
- [ ] Determine pooling feasibility

### 2. Transport-Specific Considerations

#### HTTP/SSE
- [ ] Can HTTP connections be reused across sessions?
- [ ] How do cookies/auth headers work?
- [ ] SSE connection lifecycle
- [ ] Keep-alive and connection limits

#### Stdio
- [ ] Is pooling even possible?
- [ ] Process lifecycle constraints
- [ ] Multiplexing possibilities

### 3. Security Analysis
- [ ] Session isolation requirements
- [ ] Authentication token handling
- [ ] Cross-session data leakage risks
- [ ] Audit and compliance needs

### 4. Performance Trade-offs
- [ ] Connection establishment overhead
- [ ] Memory usage per connection
- [ ] Complexity vs benefit analysis
- [ ] When pooling helps vs hurts

### 5. Implementation Strategies
- [ ] Per-upstream pools
- [ ] Global connection pool
- [ ] Session affinity options
- [ ] Pool size limits

## Deliverables
Create `analysis/connection-pooling-strategy.md` with:
1. Feasibility assessment
2. Security considerations
3. Recommended approach (pool or not)
4. Implementation guidelines if pooling

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear decision on pooling strategy
- [ ] Security implications understood
- [ ] Performance trade-offs documented
- [ ] Implementation approach defined
