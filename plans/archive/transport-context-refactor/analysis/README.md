# Transport Context Refactor - Phase 0 Complete ✅

## ⚡ IMPORTANT: Use Simplified Approach

**Shadowcat hasn't been released yet - we have NO external users!**

This changes everything:
- ✅ **USE:** [migration-strategy-simplified.md](migration-strategy-simplified.md) - 30-40 hours, direct replacement
- ❌ **DON'T USE:** ~~migration-strategy.md~~ - obsolete 60-hour plan with compatibility layers
- ❌ **IGNORE:** ~~breaking-changes.md~~ - not relevant without users

## Overview

Phase 0 of the Transport Context Refactor is **100% complete**. All analysis and design work has been completed, providing a solid foundation for implementation.

## Completed Deliverables (All Tasks)

### Protocol & Architecture Analysis (A.0, A.1)
- **[mcp-protocol-layers.md](mcp-protocol-layers.md)** - MCP protocol layer analysis
  - ✅ Confirmed: Notifications ARE bidirectional
  - ✅ Problem: Direction is implicit, not carried with messages
  
- **[architecture-clarification.md](architecture-clarification.md)** - Layer separation and ownership
  - ✅ Defined Transport, MCP, and JSON-RPC layer boundaries
  - ✅ Proposed MessageEnvelope structure

- **[transport-message-usage.md](transport-message-usage.md)** - Usage analysis across codebase
  - ✅ 34 files, 330 occurrences (corrected from initial estimate)
  - ✅ Session Manager is critical with 44 occurrences
  - ✅ No dead imports found
  
- **[current-workarounds.md](current-workarounds.md)** - Catalog of existing workarounds
  - ✅ 17 distinct workaround patterns documented
  - ✅ Shows the technical debt from missing context

- **[migration-impact.md](migration-impact.md)** - Impact assessment and timeline
  - ✅ Total estimate: 60 hours (7.5 person-days)
  - ✅ Phased migration approach defined
  - ✅ Risk matrix and mitigation strategies

### Design & Strategy (A.2, A.3, A.4)
- **[message-envelope-design.md](message-envelope-design.md)** - Complete MessageEnvelope architecture
  - ✅ Full Rust type definitions
  - ✅ Memory optimization strategies
  - ✅ Compatibility layer design
  
- **[migration-strategy.md](migration-strategy.md)** - Comprehensive migration plan
  - ✅ 6-phase incremental approach
  - ✅ Zero-downtime strategy
  - ✅ Rollback mechanisms
  
- **[breaking-changes.md](breaking-changes.md)** - Breaking changes documentation
  - ✅ All breaking changes cataloged
  - ✅ Severity and timeline for each
  - ✅ Migration paths defined

## Key Insights

1. **The core problem is confirmed**: Notifications lack direction information, breaking proxy routing
2. **The scope is manageable**: 34 files, not 90 as feared
3. **Session Manager is the lynchpin**: Must be migrated carefully
4. **Workarounds are pervasive**: 17 patterns show this refactor is overdue
5. **Performance impact acceptable**: <5% latency, ~28% memory per message
