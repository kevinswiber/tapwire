# Design Decisions: Tape Storage Providers

## Overview

This document captures key design decisions made during the analysis and design phase of the tape storage providers feature. Each decision includes context, alternatives considered, rationale, and implications.

## Decision Log

### DD-001: Use Trait-Based Abstraction

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to support multiple storage backends while maintaining type safety and performance.

**Decision**: Use a trait-based abstraction with `TapeStorageBackend` as the core interface.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Enum-based dispatch**: Single enum with variants for each backend
2. **Plugin system with dynamic loading**: Runtime plugin discovery via shared libraries
3. **Message-passing architecture**: Backends as separate processes/services

**Rationale**:
- Traits provide compile-time type safety
- Zero-cost abstraction when used with static dispatch
- Familiar pattern in Rust ecosystem
- Enables both static and dynamic dispatch as needed

**Implications**:
- Must use `async-trait` for async methods
- Dynamic dispatch has ~3.4x performance overhead
- All backends must implement the full trait

---

### DD-002: Async-First API Design

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Storage operations are inherently I/O bound and benefit from async execution.

**Decision**: All storage operations are async by default using `async/await`.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Sync API with blocking operations**
2. **Dual API (both sync and async)**
3. **Callback-based async**

**Rationale**:
- Shadowcat already uses Tokio throughout
- Enables high concurrency without thread overhead
- Natural fit for network-based storage (S3, Redis)
- Future-proof for streaming operations

**Implications**:
- Requires `async-trait` crate until async traits stabilize
- All backends must be async, even if wrapping sync code
- Testing requires async test runtime

---

### DD-003: Registry Pattern for Provider Management

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to manage multiple storage providers and enable runtime selection.

**Decision**: Implement a global registry with optional instance-level overrides.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Compile-time selection via features**
2. **Direct instantiation without registry**
3. **Service locator pattern**

**Rationale**:
- Enables runtime provider selection
- Supports custom provider registration
- Familiar pattern from web frameworks
- Allows for provider discovery and introspection

**Implications**:
- Global state via `OnceCell`
- Thread-safe access via `RwLock`
- Potential for provider naming conflicts

---

### DD-004: Configuration via serde_json::Value

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Each provider needs different configuration options.

**Decision**: Use `serde_json::Value` for provider-specific configuration.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Strongly-typed configuration enums**
2. **TOML-specific types**
3. **String-based key-value pairs**

**Rationale**:
- Maximum flexibility for custom providers
- Easy serialization/deserialization
- Supports nested configuration
- Compatible with multiple config formats

**Implications**:
- Runtime configuration validation
- Less compile-time safety
- Need good error messages for misconfiguration

---

### DD-005: Maintain Filesystem as Default

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Current users expect filesystem storage to work without configuration.

**Decision**: Filesystem provider remains the default with zero configuration required.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Require explicit provider selection**
2. **SQLite as new default**
3. **Memory storage as default**

**Rationale**:
- 100% backward compatibility
- Zero breaking changes
- Simplest option for development
- No additional dependencies

**Implications**:
- Must extract current implementation carefully
- Default configuration points to `./tapes`
- Migration path must be optional

---

### DD-006: Factory Pattern for Provider Creation

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Providers may require complex initialization logic.

**Decision**: Use factory pattern with `StorageProviderFactory` trait.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Direct construction via `new()`**
2. **Builder pattern for each provider**
3. **Prototype pattern with cloning**

**Rationale**:
- Separates construction from usage
- Enables validation before creation
- Supports async initialization
- Consistent interface for all providers

**Implications**:
- Two-step creation (factory then backend)
- Additional trait to implement
- More complex but more flexible

---

### DD-007: Optional Trait Extensions

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Not all backends support advanced features like streaming or transactions.

**Decision**: Define optional traits (`StreamingBackend`, `TransactionalBackend`) that providers can implement.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Single trait with default implementations**
2. **Capability flags in base trait**
3. **Runtime feature detection**

**Rationale**:
- Backends only implement what they support
- Compile-time feature detection possible
- Clear separation of concerns
- Extensible for future features

**Implications**:
- Runtime checks for capability support
- More complex type hierarchy
- Documentation must clarify support matrix

---

### DD-008: No Breaking Changes to Tape Format

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Existing tapes must remain readable.

**Decision**: Keep the current `Tape` structure and JSON serialization format unchanged.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **New format with migration tool**
2. **Versioned format with compatibility layer**
3. **Binary format for efficiency**

**Rationale**:
- Zero disruption to existing users
- Tapes remain portable across versions
- JSON is debuggable and tool-friendly
- Compression can address size concerns

**Implications**:
- Some inefficiency in storage size
- Limited to JSON-compatible data types
- Future format changes need careful planning

---

### DD-009: Error Handling Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Different backends have different error types.

**Decision**: Unified error type with source preservation and downcast capability.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Generic error trait objects**
2. **Backend-specific error enums**
3. **String-based errors**

**Rationale**:
- Consistent error handling across providers
- Preserves error source for debugging
- Compatible with `anyhow` and `thiserror`
- Enables error recovery strategies

**Implications**:
- Loss of backend-specific error details
- Need comprehensive error documentation
- Error mapping in each provider

---

### DD-010: Testing Strategy

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Need to ensure all providers behave consistently.

**Decision**: Shared test suite that all providers must pass.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Provider-specific test suites**
2. **Property-based testing only**
3. **Integration tests only**

**Rationale**:
- Ensures behavioral compatibility
- Catches implementation differences
- Provides conformance testing
- Enables provider certification

**Implications**:
- All providers must pass the same tests
- May limit provider-specific optimizations
- Need test fixtures and utilities

## Open Questions

1. **Should we support provider chaining/composition?**
   - Use case: Write-through cache, fallback providers
   - Complexity: Significantly increases design complexity
   - Decision: Defer to Phase 5

2. **How to handle provider versioning?**
   - Challenge: Providers may evolve independently
   - Options: Semantic versioning, capability flags
   - Decision: Start with simple version string, revisit if needed

3. **Should providers support partial tape loading?**
   - Use case: Large tapes, streaming playback
   - Challenge: Not all backends can support this
   - Decision: Optional trait extension in Phase 3

## Conclusion

These design decisions prioritize backward compatibility, extensibility, and production readiness while following established Rust patterns. The trait-based architecture with a registry system provides the flexibility needed for diverse storage backends while maintaining type safety and performance where possible.

The phased implementation approach allows for iterative refinement based on user feedback while minimizing disruption to existing users.
