# Task A.1: Storage Patterns Research

## Objective

Research storage backend patterns in similar projects to identify best practices for implementing pluggable storage providers in Shadowcat.

## Background

To design an optimal storage provider system, we should learn from existing implementations in:
- Database abstraction layers (sqlx, diesel)
- Object storage systems (S3 clients, cloud storage SDKs)
- Plugin architectures in Rust projects
- Tape/recording systems in other tools

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What patterns do successful storage abstractions use?
2. How do other projects handle provider registration and discovery?
3. What are common pitfalls in storage abstraction design?
4. How is async storage typically handled in Rust?
5. What configuration patterns work well for storage providers?

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Research Phase (60 min)
Investigate storage patterns in key projects:

```bash
# Research targets
# - sqlx: Database abstraction
# - object_store: Cloud storage abstraction
# - tantivy: Search engine storage
# - rocksdb: Storage engine bindings
```

Key areas to investigate:
- Trait design for storage backends
- Factory patterns and registration
- Configuration and initialization
- Error handling patterns
- Async patterns and lifetime management

### 2. Pattern Analysis (30 min)
Document common patterns found:

- Provider registration mechanisms
- Configuration patterns
- Initialization and lifecycle management
- Error handling strategies
- Performance optimization techniques

### 3. Best Practices Compilation (20 min)
Compile best practices:

- DO: Patterns that work well
- DON'T: Common mistakes to avoid
- CONSIDER: Trade-offs to evaluate

### 4. Documentation Phase (10 min)
Create research findings document

## Expected Deliverables

### Research Documents
- `analysis/storage-patterns-research.md` - Comprehensive research findings
- Comparison matrix of different approaches
- Recommended patterns for Shadowcat

### Key Findings
- List of applicable design patterns
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Performance considerations
- Configuration best practices

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] At least 5 relevant projects analyzed
- [ ] Common patterns identified and documented
- [ ] Best practices compiled
- [ ] Anti-patterns identified
- [ ] Research document complete
- [ ] Recommendations for Shadowcat documented

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Over-engineering the solution | HIGH | Focus on Shadowcat's specific needs |
| Missing Rust-specific patterns | MEDIUM | Focus on Rust projects |

## Duration Estimate

**Total: 2 hours**
- Research: 60 minutes
- Pattern analysis: 30 minutes
- Best practices: 20 minutes
- Documentation: 10 minutes

## Dependencies

- A.0: Current State Analysis (understand our starting point)

## Integration Points

- Will inform the trait design in Phase B
- Configuration patterns will affect API design
- Error handling patterns will influence implementation

## Performance Considerations

- Async vs sync trade-offs
- Connection pooling patterns
- Caching strategies
- Batch operation patterns

## Notes

- Focus on production-ready patterns
- Consider Shadowcat's pre-release status (can break compatibility)
- Look for patterns that support future extensibility

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Clone and examine reference projects
git clone https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx /tmp/sqlx
git clone https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs /tmp/arrow-rs

# Search for patterns
rg -t rust "trait.*Storage|trait.*Backend" /tmp/sqlx
rg -t rust "impl.*Provider|Factory" /tmp/arrow-rs

# Look for registration patterns
rg -t rust "register|Registry" /tmp/sqlx
```

## Example Patterns to Research

```rust
// Factory pattern example
trait StorageFactory {
    fn create(&self, config: Config) -> Result<Box<dyn Storage>>;
}

// Registration pattern
struct Registry {
    providers: HashMap<String, Box<dyn StorageFactory>>,
}

// Builder pattern
struct StorageBuilder {
    // configuration
}
```
