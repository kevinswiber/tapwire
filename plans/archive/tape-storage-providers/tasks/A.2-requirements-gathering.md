# Task A.2: Requirements Gathering

## Objective

Define comprehensive requirements for the tape storage provider system based on user needs, use cases, and technical constraints.

## Background

Before designing the storage provider API, we need to understand:
- What storage backends users want to use
- What operations they need to perform
- Performance and scalability requirements
- Configuration and deployment scenarios

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What storage backends should we support initially?
2. What operations beyond basic CRUD are needed?
3. What are the performance requirements?
4. How should providers be configured and initialized?
5. What metadata and search capabilities are needed?

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Use Case Analysis (30 min)
Document key use cases:

- Local development (filesystem)
- Production deployment (database, cloud storage)
- CI/CD environments (in-memory, temp storage)
- Large-scale deployments (distributed storage)
- Compliance scenarios (encryption, retention)

### 2. Feature Requirements (30 min)
Define required features:

Core Operations:
- Save/Load/Delete tapes
- List and search tapes
- Import/Export for portability

Advanced Features:
- Metadata and tagging
- Search by criteria
- Bulk operations
- Compression support
- Encryption at rest

### 3. Non-Functional Requirements (20 min)
Define quality attributes:

- Performance targets (latency, throughput)
- Scalability requirements
- Reliability and durability
- Security requirements
- Compatibility requirements

### 4. Documentation Phase (10 min)
Compile requirements document

## Expected Deliverables

### Requirements Documents
- `analysis/requirements-analysis.md` - Complete requirements specification
- Use case diagrams
- Priority matrix for features

### Key Outputs
- Prioritized feature list
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Configuration requirements

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] All use cases documented
- [ ] Core operations defined
- [ ] Advanced features prioritized
- [ ] Performance targets established
- [ ] Security requirements clear
- [ ] Requirements document complete

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep | HIGH | Focus on MVP features first |
| Conflicting requirements | MEDIUM | Prioritize and document trade-offs |

## Duration Estimate

**Total: 1.5 hours**
- Use case analysis: 30 minutes
- Feature requirements: 30 minutes
- Non-functional requirements: 20 minutes
- Documentation: 10 minutes

## Dependencies

- A.0: Current State Analysis
- A.1: Storage Patterns Research

## Integration Points

- Requirements will drive API design
- Performance requirements affect implementation choices
- Configuration requirements influence factory design

## Performance Considerations

Key metrics to define:
- Tape save latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Tape load latency
- List operation performance with N tapes
- Search performance requirements
- Concurrent operation support

## Notes

- Consider both current and future needs
- Balance flexibility with simplicity
- Think about debugging and observability

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Check current usage patterns
cd shadowcat
rg -t rust "save_tape|load_tape" 

# Look for performance tests
cargo test --bench

# Check for existing feature requests
# (Would check GitHub issues in real scenario)
```

## Example Requirements

### Functional Requirements
```
FR-1: System SHALL support filesystem storage
FR-2: System SHALL support SQLite storage
FR-3: System SHALL allow custom storage providers
FR-4: System SHALL support concurrent tape operations
```

### Non-Functional Requirements
```
NFR-1: Tape save SHALL complete in < 100ms for 1MB tape
NFR-2: System SHALL support 100,000+ tapes
NFR-3: Storage providers SHALL be configurable via TOML
```
