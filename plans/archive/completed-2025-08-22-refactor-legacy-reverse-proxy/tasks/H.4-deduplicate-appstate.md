# Task H.4: Deduplicate AppState Creation

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-08-19)

## Objective
Remove duplicated AppState creation logic by consolidating into a single function.

## Problem
AppState was being created in three different places with significant code duplication:
1. `ReverseProxyServer::new()` - Lines 125-138
2. `ReverseProxyServer::with_upstream()` - Lines 151-164  
3. `create_app_state()` function - Lines 543-556

This led to:
- Maintenance burden (changes needed in 3 places)
- Risk of inconsistency
- Harder to track initialization logic

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Split create_app_state into sync and async versions
```rust
// Sync version for use in constructors
fn create_app_state_sync(...) -> AppState

// Async version that sets up interceptors
async fn create_app_state(...) -> AppState
```

### 2. Updated all AppState creation to use centralized function
- `new()` constructor now calls `create_app_state_sync()`
- `with_upstream()` now calls `create_app_state_sync()`
- Async contexts continue using `create_app_state()`

### 3. Benefits
- Single source of truth for AppState initialization
- Reduced code duplication (~50 lines removed)
- Easier to maintain and modify
- Consistent initialization across all code paths

## Files Modified
- `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat/src/proxy/reverse/server.rs`

## Tests Run
- `cargo check --lib` ✅
- `cargo test --lib reverse::server` ✅  
- Integration tests continue to pass ✅

## Success Criteria
- [x] Single function creates AppState
- [x] No code duplication
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] No functional changes
