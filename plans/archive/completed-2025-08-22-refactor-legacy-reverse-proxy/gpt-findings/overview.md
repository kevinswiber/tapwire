# GPT Findings: Phase H Plan Review

Date: 2025-08-19

## Verdict (Post Pool-Fix Pass)

The Phase H plan remains directionally correct. The connection pool issues are resolved: the maintenance loop now owns the return receiver, first-tick bias is handled, the Drop-to-return error path explicitly closes connections (with timeout), and a last-reference async cleanup backstop is in place. Remaining high-value items: subprocess health semantics (stdio), SSE reconnection integration, ReverseProxyServer shutdown/Drop, and documentation/benchmarks.

## Key Observations

- Pool fixes are implemented in code: receiver ownership moved into the maintenance task; idle cleanup avoids awaits while holding locks; backpressure path closes connections; last-ref Drop spawns async cleanup. Subprocess health semantics still need attention.
- SSE reconnection (H.4) needs concrete reconnection policy (backoff, jitter, caps) and tests to avoid regressions.
- Success criteria include valgrind-based leak testing, which is impractical in typical Rust/Tokio workflows; propose more actionable alternatives.
- The plan calls out performance targets but lacks a lightweight, repeatable benchmark script and clear acceptance metrics per task.
