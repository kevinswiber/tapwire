# MCP Specification Compliance Research Plan
## Version: 2025-06-18

## Objective
Systematically analyze Shadowcat's implementation against the MCP 2025-06-18 specification to identify all compliance gaps, with particular focus on Server-sent Events (SSE) support and transport layer requirements.

- [ ] Missing error codes or handling

#### 3.3 Minor Gaps (Quality/Performance)
- [ ] Suboptimal implementations
- [ ] Missing optional features
- [ ] Performance deviations from spec recommendations
- [ ] Documentation mismatches

### Phase 4: Implementation Plan
**Goal**: Prioritized roadmap for achieving compliance

#### 4.1 Immediate Fixes (< 1 day each)
- [ ] Quick wins and configuration changes
- [ ] Missing constants or headers
- [ ] Simple message type additions

#### 4.2 Short-term Implementations (1-3 days each)
- [ ] SSE transport implementation
- [ ] Missing utilities
- [ ] Protocol corrections

#### 4.3 Long-term Enhancements (> 3 days)
- [ ] Major architectural changes
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Advanced feature implementations

## Execution Strategy

### Step 1: Specification Deep Dive (2-3 hours)
1. Read all specification files systematically
2. Create compliance checklist document
3. Note all MUST, SHOULD, MAY requirements
4. Pay special attention to SSE requirements

### Step 2: Codebase Mapping (2-3 hours)
1. Use grep/search for spec-related terms
2. Map implementations to spec requirements
3. Document what exists vs what's missing
4. Use rust-code-reviewer for critical components

### Step 3: Gap Documentation (1-2 hours)
1. Create detailed gap analysis document
2. Categorize by severity and effort
3. Include code references for existing implementations
4. Provide spec references for missing features

### Step 4: Implementation Roadmap (1 hour)
1. Prioritize based on criticality
2. Estimate effort for each gap
3. Create actionable tasks with clear acceptance criteria
4. Define testing strategy for compliance

## Key Areas of Concern

### Server-sent Events (SSE)
**Primary concern**: The codebase likely lacks SSE support entirely
- Required for HTTP transport streaming responses
- Critical for long-running operations
- Needed for progress notifications
- Essential for real-time updates

### Transport Abstraction
- Must support multiple concurrent transports
- Need proper transport negotiation
- Require transport-specific error handling

### Session Lifecycle
- Proper initialization sequence
- Clean shutdown procedures
- Resource cleanup guarantees
- Session recovery mechanisms

### Message Framing
- Correct JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation
- Proper error response formatting
- Batch request handling
- Notification vs request distinction

## Deliverables

1. **Compliance Checklist** (`002-mcp-spec-compliance-checklist.md`)
   - Complete list of spec requirements
   - Checkbox format for tracking

2. **Gap Analysis Report** (`003-mcp-spec-gap-analysis.md`)
   - Detailed comparison of spec vs implementation
   - Severity ratings for each gap
   - Code references and spec citations

3. **Implementation Roadmap** (`004-mcp-compliance-implementation-roadmap.md`)
   - Prioritized task list
   - Effort estimates
   - Dependencies and blockers
   - Testing requirements

4. **SSE Implementation Design** (`005-sse-transport-design.md`)
   - Architecture for SSE support
   - Integration with existing transport layer
   - Testing strategy

## Success Criteria

- [ ] 100% of MUST requirements identified
- [ ] All existing implementations mapped to spec
- [ ] All gaps documented with severity
- [ ] Clear implementation path defined
- [ ] SSE support design completed
- [ ] Testing strategy defined for compliance validation

## Timeline Estimate

- Research Phase: 6-8 hours
- Documentation: 2-3 hours
- Total: 8-11 hours for complete analysis

## Critical Architecture Requirement

**Multi-Version Support**: The architecture must be flexible enough to support multiple MCP specification versions simultaneously. This is essential for:
- Backward compatibility with older clients/servers
- Forward compatibility with newer specifications
- Gradual migration between versions
- Testing against different specification versions

See `005-multi-version-architecture-design.md` for detailed architectural design for multi-version support.

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1.1 - read core protocol requirements
2. Create compliance checklist as we go
3. Focus on SSE requirements early
4. Use automated tools to search codebase for implementations
5. Design version abstraction layer for future flexibility
