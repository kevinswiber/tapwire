- Standardized error handling
- Added comprehensive integration tests

### Phase B.7: Code Review Fixes ✅
- Fixed shutdown task detachment
- Implemented reverse proxy shutdown
- Added must-use attributes
- Improved error context
- Added debug assertions

### Phase C: Quality & Testing ✅
- Comprehensive documentation
- Configuration file support (TOML/YAML)
- Improved error messages
- Telemetry and metrics (OpenTelemetry + Prometheus)
- Performance optimization (HTTP pooling, buffer constants)
- Extensive test coverage (property tests)
- **Shell completions** (bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell)
- **Connection pooling** (evaluated and skipped stdio pooling)
- **Load testing** (performance tests, all targets met)
- **Release preparation** (CHANGELOG, README updates)

## Final Metrics

- **Tests**: 802 passing, 0 failing
- **Clippy**: Zero warnings with `-D warnings`
- **Performance**:

  - Memory: < 100MB for 1000 sessions ✅
  - Throughput: > 10,000 ops/second ✅
  - Latency overhead: < 5% ✅
- **Code Quality**: Grade A from comprehensive review

## Project Files

### Main Refactor Location
- `/Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-cli-refactor` (git worktree)

### Documentation
- `plans/cli-refactor-optimization/cli-optimization-tracker.md` - Complete project tracker
- `shadowcat-cli-refactor/docs/` - Architecture and configuration guides
- `shadowcat-cli-refactor/examples/` - 6 example programs

### Key Features Added
1. Library-first architecture
2. Shell completions support
3. Performance test suite
4. Graceful shutdown system
5. Configuration management
6. Telemetry integration

## Next Steps

The Shadowcat CLI refactor is production-ready. Possible next steps:

1. **Merge to main**: Merge the shadowcat-cli-refactor branch
2. **Publish to crates.io**: When ready for first release
3. **Performance tuning**: Run load tests in production environment
4. **Additional features**: Consider implementing from the original Tapwire vision

The refactor has transformed Shadowcat from a CLI-only tool into a robust, production-ready library with excellent performance characteristics and comprehensive testing.
