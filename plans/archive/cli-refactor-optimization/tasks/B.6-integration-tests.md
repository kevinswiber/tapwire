# B.6: Add Basic Integration Tests

**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Duration**: 2 hours (actual: ~3 hours)  
**Completed**: 2025-08-11

## Objective

Add comprehensive integration tests for the Shadowcat high-level API to ensure the library works correctly as a whole.

## Implementation Summary

### Test Organization

Created three test files with different approaches:

1. **`tests/integration_api_simple.rs`** (14 tests)
   - Non-async tests for builder patterns
   - Configuration validation
   - Error handling checks
   - All passing

2. **`tests/integration_api_mock.rs`** (6 tests)
   - Mock transport implementation
   - Tests proxy lifecycle with controlled message flow
   - Tests shutdown controller integration
   - Session management and cleanup
   - All passing

3. **`tests/integration_api.rs`** (10 tests, marked as ignored)
   - Tests that require actual stdio connections
   - Cannot run in automated test environment
   - Documented why they're ignored
   - Useful for manual testing

### Key Challenges Resolved

1. **Proxy Lifecycle Issue**
   - Problem: `ForwardProxy::start()` waits for shutdown signal, causing tests to hang
   - Solution: Spawn proxy in background task and abort after testing
   - MockTransport provides proper message flow then signals completion

2. **Mock Transport Design**
   - Implemented full `Transport` trait
   - Provides initialize request/response sequence
   - Properly handles connection state with atomics
   - Supports configurable shutdown after N messages

3. **Test Environment Limitations**
   - `forward_stdio()` creates `StdioClientTransport` that reads from actual stdin
   - This blocks in test environment with no stdin
   - Solution: Mock-based tests for automation, ignored tests for manual verification

## Test Coverage Summary

```
Total Tests: 781
- Unit tests: 684 (all passing)
- E2E tests: 97 (all passing)
- Integration tests: 20 active + 10 ignored
  - integration_api_simple: 14 passing
  - integration_api_mock: 6 passing
  - integration_api: 10 ignored (require stdin/stdout)
```

## Files Modified

- `tests/integration_api_simple.rs` - Created with 14 builder/config tests
- `tests/integration_api_mock.rs` - Created with mock transport and 6 async tests
- `tests/integration_api.rs` - Updated with ignore attributes and documentation
- `tests/common/mock_servers.rs` - Added mock command helpers

## Key Insights

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Different test approaches for different aspects
   - Simple tests for synchronous APIs
   - Mock tests for async proxy behavior
   - Ignored tests for manual verification

2. **Transport Abstraction Works**: Mock transport proves the abstraction is solid
   - Easy to implement custom transports
   - Proxy properly handles different transport types
   - Clean separation between transport and proxy logic

3. **Shutdown Design Validated**: Tests confirm shutdown system works correctly
   - Graceful shutdown with controller
   - Proxy cleanup on drop
   - Session manager cleanup tasks

## Next Steps

With B.6 complete, Phase B is now 75% done. Remaining Phase B tasks:
- B.4: Extract Transport Factory (3h)
- B.5: Standardize Error Handling (2h)

These can be addressed in the next session to complete Phase B and move on to Phase C (Quality & Testing).
