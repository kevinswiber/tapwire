# CLI Refactor Tracker

## Overview

This tracker coordinates the refactoring of Shadowcat's CLI implementation to move core functionality from main.rs into a modular cli module structure, improving maintainability and testability.

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-10  
**Total Estimated Duration**: 12-16 hours  
**Status**: Command Migration In Progress  
**Progress**: Phase 1 (3/3 tasks) ✅, Phase 2 (3/3 tasks) ✅, Phase 3 (4/4 tasks) ✅

## Goals

1. **Modularize CLI** - Extract all command execution logic from main.rs into dedicated cli modules
2. **Improve Testability** - Enable unit testing of CLI commands without full binary compilation
3. **Reduce main.rs** - Keep main.rs lean, focused only on argument parsing and delegation
4. **Maintain Compatibility** - Ensure all existing CLI commands work identically after refactor

## Architecture Vision

```
main.rs (lean entry point)
    ├── Parse CLI args (clap)
    ├── Initialize logging
    └── Delegate to cli module

## Key Findings from Analysis

### main.rs Current State (1294 lines)
- **CLI Structure**: Uses clap with nested subcommands
- **Major Commands**: forward, reverse, record, replay, tape, intercept, session
- **Helper Functions**: 
  - HTTP proxy handlers (3 functions, ~200 lines)
  - JSON conversion utilities (2 functions, ~50 lines)
  - Message matching helper (1 function, ~10 lines)
- **Configuration**: ProxyConfig struct with session/rate limiting settings
- **Duplication**: Rate limiter setup code repeated 4 times

### Existing CLI Modules
- `cli/tape.rs`: Already modularized
- `cli/intercept.rs`: Already modularized  
- `cli/session.rs`: Already modularized
- `cli/mod.rs`: Simple re-exports only

### Migration Opportunities
1. **ProxyConfig** → `cli/common.rs` (shared by forward/reverse/replay)
2. **Forward proxy logic** → `cli/forward.rs` (~400 lines)
3. **Reverse proxy logic** → `cli/reverse.rs` (~100 lines)
4. **Recording logic** → `cli/record.rs` (~250 lines)
5. **Replay logic** → `cli/replay.rs` (~200 lines)
6. **HTTP handlers** → `cli/handlers.rs` (shared utilities)

## Session Planning Guidelines

### Optimal Session Structure
1. **Review** (5 min): Check this tracker and relevant task files
2. **Implementation** (2-3 hours): Complete the task deliverables
3. **Testing** (30 min): Run tests, fix issues
4. **Documentation** (15 min): Update tracker, create PR if needed
5. **Handoff** (10 min): Update NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md if needed

### Context Window Management
- Each task is designed to require < 50% context window
- If approaching 70% usage, create NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md
- Keep focus on single task to avoid context bloat
- Reference documentation only when needed

### Task Completion Criteria
- [ ] All deliverables checked off
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] No clippy warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tracker status updated

## Next Actions

Phase 2 ✅ Complete! Ready to begin Phase 3:

1. **Migrate forward proxy commands** (C.1) - Move stdio and HTTP forward proxy logic
2. **Migrate reverse proxy command** (C.2) - Move reverse proxy implementation
3. **Migrate record commands** (C.3) - Move recording functionality
4. **Migrate replay command** (C.4) - Move replay implementation

## Notes

- Existing tape, intercept, and session modules provide good patterns to follow
- Rate limiting and session configuration is heavily duplicated - prime candidate for extraction ✅ RESOLVED
- HTTP proxy handlers could be shared utilities or part of forward module
- Consider keeping clap structs in main.rs for clarity, moving only execution logic

## Key Findings from Phase 2 Implementation

### Infrastructure Achievements
- **Created `src/cli/common.rs`**: Central module for shared CLI utilities with ProxyConfig struct
- **Configuration Consolidation**: Successfully extracted duplicated rate limiter and session manager setup into factory functions
- **JSON Utilities**: Added robust JSON conversion with proper error handling for stdin/stdout
- **Error Infrastructure**: Comprehensive error handling utilities with validation and exit codes
- **Module Stubs**: Created forward.rs, reverse.rs, record.rs, replay.rs ready for command migration
- **Test Coverage**: 24 unit tests covering all common module functionality

### Technical Insights
- **Pattern Recognition**: Clear patterns emerged for configuration factories that eliminate duplication
- **Error Handling**: Standardized approach using ShadowcatError with context provides good UX
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit testing CLI utilities separately from main.rs enables much better testability
- **Module Boundaries**: Clean separation between common utilities and command-specific logic works well
- **Validation**: Input validation utilities provide consistent error messages across commands

### Code Quality Results
- **All tests passing**: 24 unit tests with comprehensive coverage
- **No clippy warnings**: Code follows Rust best practices
- **CLI compatibility**: Existing CLI commands continue to work unchanged during refactor

## Phase 3 C.1 Accomplishments (2025-08-10)

### Forward Proxy Migration Complete
- **Migrated Functions**: 
  - `run_stdio_forward()` - 110 lines moved to cli/forward.rs
  - `run_http_forward_proxy()` - 60 lines moved to cli/forward.rs
- **Configuration Integration**: ForwardCommand now includes all ProxyConfig fields
- **main.rs Reduction**: 1294 → 975 lines (319 lines removed, 24.6% reduction)
- **Module Size**: cli/forward.rs is 328 lines with full implementation and tests
- **Test Coverage**: 2 unit tests for command creation and configuration

### Technical Details
- **Import Fixes**: Updated from `shadowcat::` to `crate::` imports for library usage
- **Command Pattern**: ForwardCommand::execute() pattern established for other commands
- **ProxyConfig**: Successfully removed from main.rs, now in cli/common.rs
- **Clean Build**: No clippy warnings, all tests passing
- **Backward Compatibility**: All forward proxy commands work identically

### Remaining Work for Target
- **Current**: main.rs at 975 lines
- **Target**: < 200 lines  
- **Remaining to Remove**: ~775 lines
- **Next Migrations**: reverse (100 lines), record (250 lines), replay (200 lines) = ~550 lines
- **Additional Cleanup**: Helper functions and other utilities ~225 lines

## Phase 3 Complete Accomplishments (2025-08-10)

### All Command Migrations Complete
- **C.2 Reverse Proxy**: Migrated 103 lines to cli/reverse.rs (148 lines removed from main.rs)
- **C.3 Record Commands**: Migrated stdio and HTTP recording to cli/record.rs (292 lines removed)
- **C.4 Replay Command**: Migrated replay server to cli/replay.rs (294 lines removed)

### Final Results
- **main.rs Reduction**: 1294 → 141 lines (89% reduction, 1153 lines removed)
- **Target Achievement**: Well below 200 line target ✅
- **Module Sizes**:
  - cli/forward.rs: 328 lines (complete with tests)
  - cli/reverse.rs: 229 lines (complete with tests)
  - cli/record.rs: 400 lines (complete with tests)
  - cli/replay.rs: 408 lines (complete with tests)
  - cli/common.rs: 605 lines (shared utilities)

### Code Quality
- **All tests passing**: 8 new unit tests added across modules
- **No clippy warnings**: Clean build with -Dwarnings
- **Full CLI compatibility**: All commands work identically after refactor
- **Clean separation**: Each command fully encapsulated in its module

### Key Achievements
- Successfully extracted all command logic from main.rs
- Eliminated duplication through common utilities (ProxyConfig, rate limiting, session management)
- JSON conversion utilities moved to common module and reused across commands
- Clean main.rs now only handles CLI parsing and delegation
- Established consistent command pattern with execute() methods
