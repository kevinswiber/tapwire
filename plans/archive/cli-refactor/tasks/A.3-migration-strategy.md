# Task A.3: Plan Migration Strategy

## Objective
Create a detailed migration plan to incrementally refactor main.rs into modular CLI components while maintaining backward compatibility and minimizing risk.

## Key Questions to Answer
1. What order should modules be extracted?
2. How to maintain compatibility during migration?
3. How to test at each step?
4. What rollback options exist?
5. How to handle partial migrations?

## Process

### Step 1: Define Migration Order
- [ ] Identify dependencies between components
- [ ] Determine safest extraction order
- [ ] Plan incremental steps
- [ ] Set checkpoints for validation

### Step 2: Create Testing Strategy
- [ ] Define tests before extraction
- [ ] Plan integration test coverage
- [ ] Set up regression testing
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks

### Step 3: Risk Assessment
- [ ] Identify potential breaking changes
- [ ] Plan rollback procedures
- [ ] Document contingencies
- [ ] Set success criteria

### Step 4: Implementation Plan
- [ ] Break into small PRs
- [ ] Define review process
- [ ] Plan deployment strategy
- [ ] Create documentation updates

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Migration Roadmap (analysis/migration-roadmap.md)
```markdown
# Migration Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (Day 1)
1. Create cli/common.rs with ProxyConfig
2. Add tests for ProxyConfig
3. Update main.rs to use common::ProxyConfig

## Phase 2: Simple Commands (Day 2)
1. Extract replay command (least complex)
2. Extract record commands
3. Test each extraction

## Phase 3: Complex Commands (Day 3)
1. Extract forward commands
2. Extract reverse command
3. Comprehensive testing
```

### 2. Testing Strategy (analysis/testing-strategy.md)
```markdown
# Testing Strategy

## Before Each Extraction
1. Capture current behavior with tests
2. Record CLI output for comparison
3. Create integration test suite

## During Extraction
1. Run tests after each change
2. Compare outputs
3. Check performance
```

### 3. Rollback Plan (analysis/rollback-plan.md)
```markdown
# Rollback Plan

## Git Strategy
- Each extraction in separate commit
- Feature branch for entire refactor
- Can revert individual commits

## Code Strategy
- Keep old functions temporarily
- Use feature flags if needed
- Gradual transition
```

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b cli-refactor

# Test current behavior
cargo test --bin shadowcat

# Benchmark current performance
cargo bench

# Check current binary size
cargo build --release && du -h target/release/shadowcat
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear migration order defined
- [ ] Testing strategy documented
- [ ] Rollback procedures ready
- [ ] Risk assessment complete
- [ ] Implementation timeline set

## Time Estimate
1 hour

## Notes
- Keep changes small and incremental
- Test extensively at each step
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document all changes
