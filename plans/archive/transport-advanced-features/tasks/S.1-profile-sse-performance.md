# Task S.1: Profile SSE Performance Bottlenecks

## Objective
Identify performance bottlenecks in the SSE transport implementation to guide optimization efforts.

## Duration
1 hour

## Dependencies
- None

## Key Questions
1. Where are the memory allocation hotspots in SSE streaming?
2. What is the current buffer reuse efficiency?
3. Are there unnecessary string conversions or copies?
4. How much overhead does reconnection add?
5. Where are the parsing performance bottlenecks?

## Process

### 1. Analyze Current Implementation (20 min)
- Review SSE transport modules
- Identify allocation patterns
- Check buffer management
- Review parsing logic

### 2. Memory Profiling (20 min)
- Examine buffer allocations in parser
- Check string conversion overhead
- Identify temporary allocations
- Measure buffer pool usage

### 3. Performance Analysis (20 min)
- Identify hot paths in message flow
- Measure reconnection overhead
- Check for unnecessary copies
- Analyze parser efficiency

## Deliverables
1. Performance profile report
2. List of optimization targets
3. Baseline metrics for comparison

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Memory allocation patterns documented
- [ ] Hot paths identified
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics captured
- [ ] Optimization targets prioritized

## Notes
- Focus on data-driven optimization
- Consider existing buffer pool infrastructure
- Look for low-hanging fruit first
