# Error Fix Analysis Outputs

This directory contains analysis documents generated during the error boundary fix project.

## Documents

### Phase 0: Analysis (To be created)
- `current-error-usage.md` - Complete inventory of crate::Error/Result violations
- `module-error-status.md` - Which modules have/need Error types
- `dependency-graph.md` - Visual module dependency hierarchy
- `error-flow.md` - How errors currently propagate
- `migration-strategy.md` - Step-by-step migration plan
- `risk-assessment.md` - Identified risks and mitigations

### Raw Data Files (Temporary)
- `error-references.txt` - Raw grep output of crate::Error references
- `result-references.txt` - Raw grep output of crate::Result references
- `existing-errors.txt` - Modules that already have Error types

## Key Findings

*To be populated after analysis*

### High-Priority Modules
1. TBD after analysis

### Major Patterns Identified
1. TBD after analysis

### Recommended Approach
TBD after analysis

## Metrics

### Before
- Total violations: 161+ references to crate::Error
- Modules affected: TBD
- Functions affected: TBD

### After (Target)
- Total violations: 0
- Modules with proper errors: All
- Clean error chains: 100%

## Notes

This analysis drives the entire refactoring effort. The quality of the analysis directly impacts the success of the migration.
