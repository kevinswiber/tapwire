## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Interceptor Engine
**File:** `src/interceptor/engine.rs`  
**Details:** [tasks/010-interceptor-engine.md](tasks/010-interceptor-engine.md)  
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days

**Core Architecture:**
```rust
pub struct InterceptorChain {
    interceptors: Vec<Box<dyn Interceptor + Send + Sync>>,
    registry: InterceptorRegistry,
    metrics: InterceptorMetrics,
}

#[async_trait]
pub trait Interceptor {
    async fn intercept(&self, ctx: &InterceptContext) -> InterceptResult<InterceptAction>;
    fn priority(&self) -> u32;
    fn name(&self) -> &str;

## Technical Architecture

### Integration with Existing Components

**ForwardProxy Integration:**
```rust
impl ForwardProxy {
    async fn route_message(&mut self, message: TransportMessage, direction: Direction) -> ProxyResult<()> {
        // Phase 4: Add interceptor chain hook
        let intercept_ctx = InterceptContext::new(&message, direction, &self.session_id);
        
        match self.interceptor_chain.intercept(&intercept_ctx).await? {
            InterceptAction::Continue => {
                // Existing routing logic
                self.route_message_internal(message, direction).await
            }
            InterceptAction::Modify(modified_msg) => {
                self.route_message_internal(modified_msg, direction).await
            }
            InterceptAction::Block { reason } => {
                self.send_error_response(&message, &reason).await
            }
            InterceptAction::Mock { response } => {
                self.send_mock_response(response, direction).await
            }
            InterceptAction::Pause { resume_tx } => {
                self.handle_pause(message, direction, resume_tx).await
            }
            InterceptAction::Delay { duration, then } => {
                tokio::time::sleep(duration).await;
                self.execute_delayed_action(*then, message, direction).await
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Session Integration:**
- Intercepted messages recorded to tapes with interception metadata
- Session tags can trigger specific rule sets
- Interception events generate audit logs
- Session statistics include interception metrics

**Replay Integration:**
- Replay tapes with interception enabled
- Compare original vs intercepted message flows
- Test rule effectiveness against recorded sessions
- Generate rule suggestions from replay analysis

### Performance Considerations

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Optional Interception:** Zero overhead when no interceptors are registered
- **Rule Indexing:** Fast rule matching with bloom filters and indexing
- **Async Design:** Non-blocking interception with timeout handling
- **Memory Management:** Efficient message cloning and modification
- **Metrics Collection:** Lightweight performance monitoring

**Performance Targets:**
- Interception overhead: < 1ms p95 when enabled, 0ms when disabled
- Rule evaluation: < 100Î¼s per rule for typical MCP messages
- Interactive response: < 50ms for user actions in CLI
- Memory usage: < 10MB for typical rule sets
