# Session Summary: Traffic Recording Refactor (2025-08-17)

## Accomplishments

### 1. Completed Analysis & Design (Tasks A.2, A.3)
- Created comprehensive [recording architecture design](recording-architecture.md)
- Developed detailed [migration plan](migration-plan.md)
- Key decision: Use `RawWireData` structure to pass wire format alongside `MessageEnvelope`
- Key insight: No backward compatibility needed since shadowcat is unreleased

### 2. Started Implementation (Task B.1)
- Consolidated SseEvent types by simplifying internal buffering
- Initially renamed `SseEvent` → `BufferedSseEvent` in `transport/outgoing/http.rs`
- Further simplified: Removed unnecessary `BufferedSseEvent` struct entirely
- Now using `VecDeque<Vec<u8>>` directly since only data bytes are needed
- Eliminated dead code (unused event_type and id fields)
- All tests passing after refactor

## Key Design Decisions

### RawWireData Structure
```rust
pub struct RawWireData {
    pub bytes: Arc<Vec<u8>>,  // Shared via Arc for efficiency
    pub format: WireFormat,    // Json/ServerSentEvent/Unknown
    pub direction: DataDirection,  // ClientToServer/ServerToClient
}
```

### Updated TransportContext (Planned)
```rust
pub enum TransportContext {
    Stdio { /* unchanged */ },
    Http {
        // ... existing fields ...
        response_mode: Option<ResponseMode>,  // NEW: Json/SseStream/Passthrough
    }
    // Sse variant to be removed
}
```

### Recording Flow
1. Transport receives raw bytes from wire
2. Transport parses message, creates MessageEnvelope
3. Transport passes both envelope AND raw bytes to proxy
4. Proxy forwards both to recorder if recording enabled
5. Recorder extracts SSE metadata from raw bytes when needed

## Files Modified

### Changed
- `src/transport/outgoing/http.rs` - Renamed SseEvent to BufferedSseEvent

### Created
- `plans/traffic-recording/analysis/recording-architecture.md` - Complete design
- `plans/traffic-recording/analysis/migration-plan.md` - Step-by-step plan
- `plans/traffic-recording/analysis/session-summary-2025-08-17.md` - This summary

### Updated
- `plans/traffic-recording/traffic-recording-tracker.md` - Progress updates
- `plans/traffic-recording/next-session-prompt.md` - Updated for next session

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **B.2**: Remove TransportContext::Sse variant
2. **B.3**: Add ResponseMode to TransportContext::Http
3. **C.1**: Implement RawWireData infrastructure

### Migration Order (from plan)
1. ✅ Phase 1: Consolidate SseEvent types (DONE)
2. Phase 2: Add ResponseMode support (3 hours)
3. Phase 3: Implement raw wire data (4 hours)
4. Phase 4: Migrate Sse to Http contexts (3 hours)
5. Phase 5: Remove TransportContext::Sse (1 hour)
6. Phase 6: Update proxies (2 hours)
7. Phase 7: Testing & validation (2 hours)

## Insights Gained

### Why TransportContext::Sse is Wrong
- SSE is not a transport - it's an HTTP response format
- MCP spec only defines stdio and "Streamable HTTP" transports
- SSE metadata (event_id, retry_ms) are wire format details for replay
- Transport layer shouldn't carry wire format metadata

### Clean Architecture Benefits
- Clear separation: Transport handles messages, Recording handles wire format
- Type safety: No more untyped HashMap metadata
- Performance: Arc prevents unnecessary copies of large payloads
- Flexibility: Easy to add new wire formats in future

## Testing Status
- ✅ All unit tests passing (769 tests)
- ✅ No clippy warnings
- ✅ Specific transport::outgoing tests verified

## Time Spent
- Analysis & Design: ~2 hours
- Implementation start: ~30 minutes
- Total: ~2.5 hours

## Risk Assessment
Current implementation is stable. Next phases have increasing risk:
- Phase 2 (ResponseMode): Medium risk - touches many files
- Phase 4 (Remove Sse): High risk - core functionality change
- Mitigation: Incremental changes with testing at each step

## Recommendations for Next Session
1. Start with Phase 2 (Add ResponseMode) - foundational change
2. Run tests after each file update
3. Consider creating temporary compatibility shims
4. Focus on getting TransportContext right before RawWireData
