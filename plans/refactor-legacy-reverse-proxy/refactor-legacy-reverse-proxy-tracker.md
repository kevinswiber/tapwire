# Refactor Legacy Reverse Proxy Tracker

## Overview

Refactoring the monolithic 3,465-line `legacy.rs` reverse proxy implementation into a clean, modular architecture with proper separation of concerns.

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-19 (Session 8 - CRITICAL FIXES IN PROGRESS)  
**Total Estimated Duration**: 30-35 hours (extended due to critical issues)  
**Status**: 🔧 FIXING - Critical production issues discovered
**Working Branch**: `refactor/legacy-reverse-proxy` in shadowcat repo

## Goals

1. **Eliminate Monolith** - Delete `legacy.rs` entirely
2. **Modular Architecture** - No module exceeds 500 lines
3. **Clean Separation** - Single responsibility per module
4. **Maintain Functionality** - All tests continue passing
5. **Improve Testability** - Enable unit testing of components

## Progress Summary

- **Starting Point**: 3,465 lines in legacy.rs
- **Final State**: 0 lines - legacy.rs DELETED! ✅
- **Tests**: All passing
- **Modules Created**: 22 well-organized files
- **Achievement**: 100% reduction - complete modularization!

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED (Session 8)

### Connection Pool Not Reusing Connections
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Session 9)
- **Root Cause**: Drop implementation was shutting down maintenance loop prematurely
- **GPT-5 Analysis**: Identified multiple architectural issues
- **Fixes Applied**:
  1. ✅ Fixed semaphore leak - now uses OwnedSemaphorePermit
  2. ✅ Removed Arc<Mutex> from receiver - moved ownership to maintenance task
  3. ✅ Fixed subprocess disconnection detection
  4. ✅ Fixed lock-held-across-await in cleanup_idle_connections
  5. ✅ Fixed pool capacity check logic
  6. ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed Drop impl that was triggering shutdown on ANY clone drop
- **Verified Working**: Pool now correctly reuses connections (1 subprocess for N requests)
- **Tests Added**: test_simple_pool_reuse, test_stdio_subprocess_pool_reuse

### Performance Regressions
- **140% latency increase** at p95
- **90% throughput loss** for stdio transport
- Every request spawns new subprocess (10ms overhead)

### Missing Drop Implementation
- Server lacks Drop trait for resource cleanup
- Tasks continue running after shutdown
- Pools not properly closed

- Single responsibility per module
- Properly tested
- Well documented

## Key Achievements

### Module Organization
- ✅ Consolidated selectors (removed duplicate)
- ✅ Moved SSE streaming to `upstream/http/streaming/`
- ✅ Consolidated SSE modules (removed redundant wrappers)
- ✅ Clean module hierarchy with clear responsibilities

### Code Cleanup
- ✅ Renamed modules (removed `hyper_` prefix)
- ✅ Removed unused `handle_mcp_request` (320 lines)
- ✅ Removed redundant proxy functions (57 lines)
- ✅ Removed `echo_response` and test (68 lines)
- ✅ Fixed all unused imports

## Next Steps - Critical Issues from Review

### Phase H: Critical Fixes (URGENT - Before Merge)

Based on comprehensive review (2025-08-18), critical issues must be addressed:

1. **Fix Resource Leaks** - Connection pool, spawned tasks, missing Drop
2. **Fix Performance Regressions** - Stdio spawning, double buffering, Arc overhead
3. **Restore Missing Features** - SSE reconnection, admin endpoints, rate limiting
4. **Restore Test Coverage** - Re-add critical tests that were removed
5. **Document Breaking Changes** - Migration guides for removed features

## Success Metrics

### Original Refactoring Goals
- [x] All tests passing (19/19) ✅
- [x] No clippy warnings ✅
- [x] legacy.rs deleted ✅
- [x] No module > 500 lines ✅
- [x] Clear module boundaries ✅

### Critical Issues (From Review - MUST FIX)
- [ ] No resource leaks (connection pool, tasks)
- [ ] Performance within 5% of legacy
- [ ] SSE reconnection implemented
- [ ] Full test coverage restored
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: **HIGH** ⚠️

**Critical Issues Found (2025-08-18 Review):**
- **Resource Leaks**: Connection pool and spawned tasks will exhaust memory
- **Performance Regression**: 140% p95 latency increase, 35% throughput loss
- **Missing Features**: SSE reconnection, admin endpoints
- **Test Coverage Loss**: ~565 lines of critical tests removed

**Must Fix Before Merge:**
- Connection pool Drop implementation
- Stdio subprocess reuse (currently spawns per request!)
- SSE reconnection logic
- Restore critical test coverage

**Estimated Fix Time**: 3 days focused development

## Notes
