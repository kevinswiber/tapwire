# Task A.2: Design Session Mapping Architecture

## Objective
Design a robust and efficient architecture for dual session ID tracking that handles all identified use cases while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Questions
1. How should the mapping be stored and accessed?
2. What's the lifecycle of mapped sessions?
3. How to handle edge cases (upstream changes, failures)?
4. What's the performance impact?
5. How to ensure thread safety?

## Process

### 1. Design Core Data Structures
- [ ] Extended Session struct with dual IDs
- [ ] Session mapping table structure
- [ ] SSE event buffer design
- [ ] Last-Event-Id tracking mechanism

### 2. Define Mapping Operations
- [ ] Create proxy session
- [ ] Associate upstream session
- [ ] Lookup by proxy ID
- [ ] Lookup by upstream ID
- [ ] Remove mapping
- [ ] Handle orphaned sessions

### 3. Design SSE Reconnection Flow
- [ ] Event buffering strategy
- [ ] Last-Event-Id storage
- [ ] Replay mechanism
- [ ] Buffer size limits and eviction

### 4. Handle Edge Cases
- [ ] Upstream server changes session ID
- [ ] Upstream server restarts
- [ ] Client reconnects after long disconnect
- [ ] Multiple clients sharing upstream session
- [ ] Session migration between upstreams

### 5. Performance Considerations
- [ ] Locking strategy for concurrent access
- [ ] Memory usage with event buffers
- [ ] Lookup performance requirements
- [ ] Cleanup and garbage collection

## Deliverables
Create `analysis/session-mapping-design.md` with:
1. Detailed architecture diagrams
2. Data structure definitions
3. API design for mapping operations
4. Sequence diagrams for key flows
5. Performance analysis
6. Migration plan from current system

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete design covering all use cases
- [ ] Thread-safe concurrent access design
- [ ] Efficient lookup operations (O(1) goal)
- [ ] Memory-bounded event buffering
- [ ] Clear migration path
- [ ] No breaking changes to external APIs
