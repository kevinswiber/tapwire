# Task A.0: Analyze Current Session Management

## Objective
Understand the current session management implementation in the reverse proxy to identify all components that need modification for dual session ID tracking.

## Key Questions
1. How are sessions currently created and managed?
2. Where are session IDs used throughout the codebase?
3. What is the lifecycle of a session?
4. How do sessions interact with SSE connections?
5. What session data needs to be preserved across reconnections?

## Process

### 1. Review Core Session Components
- [ ] Examine `src/session/store.rs` - Session struct and storage
- [ ] Review `src/session/manager.rs` - SessionManager implementation
- [ ] Check `src/session/builder.rs` - Session creation patterns
- [ ] Analyze `src/session/sse_integration.rs` - SSE-specific handling

### 2. Trace Session ID Usage
- [ ] Find all uses of `SessionId` type
- [ ] Identify where session IDs are extracted from headers
- [ ] Map where session IDs are sent in responses
- [ ] Check interceptor usage of sessions

### 3. Analyze Reverse Proxy Handlers
- [ ] Review `handle_mcp_request` - How sessions are created/retrieved
- [ ] Check `handle_mcp_sse_request` - SSE session handling
- [ ] Examine `process_message` - How upstream communication works
- [ ] Look at session creation in `get_or_create_session`

### 4. Document Current Flow
- [ ] Create sequence diagram of current session flow
- [ ] Identify pain points and limitations
- [ ] Note where changes are needed

## Deliverables
Create `analysis/current-session-architecture.md` with:
1. Component inventory
2. Session ID flow diagram
3. List of all files/functions that need changes
4. Identified risks and dependencies

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete understanding of current session management
- [ ] All session ID touchpoints identified
- [ ] Clear list of components needing modification
- [ ] Risk assessment completed
