# Task A.3: Analyze Forward vs Reverse Proxy Differences

## Objective
Understand the fundamental differences between forward and reverse proxy session handling to ensure our session mapping solution is properly scoped.

## Key Questions
1. How do forward and reverse proxies differ in session management?
2. Should forward proxy remain unchanged?
3. What are the transport layer implications?
4. Can we avoid modifying the transport layer?

## Process

### 1. Forward Proxy Analysis
- [ ] Review ForwardProxy struct and implementation
- [ ] Understand single-session model
- [ ] Document session lifecycle
- [ ] Confirm no changes needed

### 2. Reverse Proxy Analysis  
- [ ] Review multi-session handling
- [ ] Understand HTTP request-based session extraction
- [ ] Map connection pooling strategy
- [ ] Document where mapping is needed

### 3. Transport Layer Assessment
- [ ] Review IncomingTransport trait
- [ ] Review OutgoingTransport trait
- [ ] Analyze MessageContext usage
- [ ] Determine if changes needed

### 4. Connection Pooling Impact
- [ ] Review current pool key structure
- [ ] Determine if pooling needs dual IDs
- [ ] Plan pooling strategy for mapped sessions

## Deliverables
Create `analysis/transport-layer-analysis.md` with:
1. Forward vs reverse proxy comparison
2. Transport layer impact assessment
3. Recommended approach (modify transports or not)
4. Risk assessment

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear understanding of proxy differences
- [ ] Decision on transport layer changes
- [ ] Scoped solution to reverse proxy only
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategy defined

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Analysis shows:
- Forward proxy needs no changes (single session model)
- Reverse proxy needs mapping (many-to-many model)
- Transport layer can remain unchanged
- Mapping should happen at reverse proxy application layer
