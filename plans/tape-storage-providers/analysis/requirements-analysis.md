## Technical Requirements

### API Design
```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait TapeStorageBackend: Send + Sync {
    async fn initialize(&mut self, config: Value) -> Result<()>;
    async fn save(&self, tape: &Tape) -> Result<TapeId>;
    async fn load(&self, id: &TapeId) -> Result<Tape>;
    async fn delete(&self, id: &TapeId) -> Result<()>;
    async fn list(&self, filter: Option<SearchCriteria>) -> Result<Vec<TapeIndexEntry>>;
    async fn search(&self, query: SearchQuery) -> Result<Vec<TapeIndexEntry>>;
    async fn stats(&self) -> Result<StorageStats>;
}
```

1. **FilesystemProvider**: Current implementation extracted
2. **SqliteProvider**: Local database with FTS5 search
3. **S3Provider**: AWS S3 compatible storage
4. **RedisProvider**: Distributed cache with persistence
5. **PostgresProvider**: Full RDBMS with JSONB support

### Configuration Schema
```toml
[recorder.storage]
provider = "s3"  # Provider name

[recorder.storage.config]
bucket = "my-tapes"
region = "us-east-1"
prefix = "shadowcat/"
compression = "gzip"
```

4. **Migration complexity**: Provide tooling and guides

### Adoption Risks
1. **Breaking changes**: Maintain strict compatibility
2. **Configuration complexity**: Sensible defaults

## Conclusion

The requirements analysis reveals significant gaps between current capabilities and user needs, particularly for production deployments. The proposed pluggable storage provider system addresses these gaps while maintaining backward compatibility. The phased approach allows incremental delivery of value while minimizing risk.

Priority should be given to establishing the core abstraction and ensuring the existing filesystem storage continues to work seamlessly. This foundation enables the community and users to contribute additional providers based on their specific needs.
