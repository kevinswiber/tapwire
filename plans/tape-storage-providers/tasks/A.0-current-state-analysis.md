# Task A.0: Current State Analysis

## Objective

Analyze the existing tape storage implementation in Shadowcat to understand its architecture, limitations, and extension points for introducing pluggable storage providers.

## Background

Shadowcat currently has a file-based tape storage system. Before designing a plugin architecture, we need to thoroughly understand:
- Current implementation patterns and dependencies
- Existing abstractions and their limitations
- Integration points with the recorder and replay systems
- Performance characteristics and bottlenecks

## Key Questions to Answer

1. How is tape storage currently implemented and what are its dependencies?
2. What are the key interfaces and data structures involved?
3. What are the current limitations that users face?
4. What are the performance characteristics of the current system?
5. How tightly coupled is the storage to other components?

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Analysis Phase (30 min)
Explore the current tape storage implementation:

```bash
# Find all tape-related code
cd shadowcat
rg -t rust "tape" --files-with-matches
rg -t rust "TapeStorage|TapeRecorder|storage" src/

# Understand the module structure
ls -la src/recorder/
cat src/recorder/mod.rs
```

### 2. Architecture Mapping (45 min)
Document the current architecture:

- Map out the current class/trait hierarchy
- Identify all storage-related operations
- Document data flow from recording to storage
- Identify serialization/deserialization points

### 3. Limitation Analysis (30 min)
Identify current limitations:

- Storage capacity constraints
- Performance bottlenecks
- Missing features (search, metadata, etc.)
- User-reported issues or requests

### 4. Documentation Phase (15 min)
Create comprehensive analysis document

## Expected Deliverables

### Analysis Documents
- `analysis/current-state-assessment.md` - Complete analysis of current implementation
- Architecture diagram showing current storage flow
- List of identified limitations and improvement opportunities

### Key Findings
- Current storage interface definition
- List of tightly coupled components
- Performance baseline measurements
- User requirements not currently met

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] All tape storage code identified and documented
- [ ] Current architecture clearly mapped
- [ ] Limitations documented with examples
- [ ] Performance characteristics measured
- [ ] Integration points identified
- [ ] Analysis document complete and reviewed

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Missing undocumented dependencies | MEDIUM | Thorough code search and testing |
| Performance regression from abstraction | HIGH | Benchmark before changes |

## Duration Estimate

**Total: 2 hours**
- Code exploration: 30 minutes
- Architecture mapping: 45 minutes
- Limitation analysis: 30 minutes
- Documentation: 15 minutes

## Dependencies

None - this is the first task

## Integration Points

- **TapeRecorder**: Primary integration point for storage
- **Replay System**: Reads tapes from storage
- **CLI**: Configures storage location
- **Session Manager**: May reference tape IDs

## Performance Considerations

- Current file I/O patterns
- Serialization overhead
- Directory scanning performance for large tape collections

## Notes

- Focus on understanding before proposing changes
- Look for existing abstraction points we can leverage
- Consider backward compatibility requirements

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Working directory
cd shadowcat

# Find tape-related code
rg -t rust "tape" --files-with-matches
rg -t rust "struct.*Tape|trait.*Storage"

# Check current tests
cargo test tape --lib

# Measure current performance
cargo bench tape
```
