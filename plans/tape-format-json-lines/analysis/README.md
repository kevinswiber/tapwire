# Tape Format JSON Lines - Analysis Documents

This directory contains analysis and design documents for the JSON Lines tape format migration.

## Documents

### [assessment.md](assessment.md)
Comprehensive assessment comparing JSON vs JSON Lines formats for tape recording, including:
- Current implementation analysis
- Benefits comparison
- Performance metrics
- Migration strategy
- Risk analysis

## Key Findings

1. **Memory Efficiency**: JSON Lines enables constant memory usage regardless of tape size
2. **Performance**: O(1) append operations vs O(n) for current format
3. **Resilience**: Partial corruption recovery possible with line-based format
4. **Compatibility**: Can maintain backward compatibility with hybrid approach

## Recommended Reading Order

1. Start with `assessment.md` for complete analysis
2. Review task files in `../tasks/` for implementation details
3. Check `../tape-format-tracker.md` for project status

## Quick Reference

### Current Format Issues
- Entire tape must fit in memory
- O(n) complexity for appending frames
- Complete data loss on file corruption
- No streaming capabilities

### JSON Lines Benefits
- Stream processing with constant memory
- O(1) append operations
- Partial recovery from corruption
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Standard UNIX tool compatibility

### Migration Approach
- Phase 1: Core streaming implementation
- Phase 2: Backward compatibility
- Phase 3: Performance optimization
