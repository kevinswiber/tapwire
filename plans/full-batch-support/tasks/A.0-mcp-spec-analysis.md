# Task A.0: MCP Specification Analysis for Batch Support

## Objective
Analyze the MCP specification to determine requirements and recommendations regarding batch message support.

## Key Questions
1. Does MCP require batch message support?
2. Does MCP explicitly forbid batch messages?
3. Are there any MCP methods that would benefit from batching?
4. How do other MCP implementations handle batches?
5. What does the JSON-RPC 2.0 spec say about batch support?

## Process

### 1. Review MCP Specification
- Check official spec at https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/
- Look for any mention of batch messages
- Review transport requirements
- Check protocol negotiation section

### 2. Analyze JSON-RPC 2.0 Requirements
- JSON-RPC 2.0 allows but doesn't require batch support
- Batches are arrays of request objects
- Responses must be in an array (even for single response)
- Order of responses doesn't need to match request order

### 3. Review MCP Reference Implementations
- Check official MCP SDK implementations
- See how they handle batch messages
- Look for examples or tests with batches

### 4. Identify Use Cases
- Multiple resource reads
- Bulk tool calls
- Parallel prompt executions
- Efficient round-trip reduction

## Expected Deliverables
- Document in `analysis/mcp-batch-requirements.md`:
  - MCP specification findings
  - JSON-RPC 2.0 requirements
  - Reference implementation approaches
  - Use case analysis
  - Recommendation summary

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear answer on MCP batch requirements
- [ ] Understanding of JSON-RPC 2.0 batch semantics
- [ ] List of potential use cases identified
- [ ] Recommendation on whether to support batches

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Search for batch-related code
rg -i "batch" src/

# Check existing tests
cargo test batch

# Review protocol tests
cargo test transport::protocol::
```

## Time Estimate
2 hours

## Dependencies
None

## Notes
- Focus on official specifications
- Consider backward compatibility
- Think about future MCP evolution
- Document any ambiguities found
