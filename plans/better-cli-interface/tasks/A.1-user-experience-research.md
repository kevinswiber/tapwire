# Task A.1: User Experience Research

## Objective

Research CLI patterns from successful developer tools to identify best practices for intuitive command interfaces. This research will guide our design decisions for the improved Shadowcat CLI.

## Background

Many developers struggle with the forward/reverse proxy terminology. By studying how other successful tools handle similar challenges, we can design a more intuitive interface that:
- Reduces cognitive load for new users
- Provides clear mental models
- Maintains power user efficiency
- Enables progressive disclosure of complexity

## Key Questions to Answer

1. How do other proxy/tunnel tools structure their CLIs? (ngrok, cloudflared, etc.)
2. What patterns do database CLIs use for connect vs serve? (psql, mysql, redis)
3. How do successful tools handle auto-detection? (git, docker, npm)
4. What makes a CLI feel "magical" vs confusing?
5. How should we handle ambiguous inputs?

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Analysis Phase (30 min)
Study successful CLI patterns

Tools to analyze:
- **ngrok**: Tunnel/proxy tool
- **docker**: Complex tool with smart defaults
- **git**: Context-aware commands
- **curl**: Connection-oriented tool
- **npm/cargo**: Package managers with workflows
- **psql/mysql**: Database clients
- **kubectl**: Resource-oriented CLI

### 2. Pattern Identification (45 min)

Identify common patterns:
- Auto-detection strategies
- Command verb choices
- Error message styles
- Help text organization
- Progressive disclosure techniques

### 3. Design Principles (45 min)

Extract design principles for Shadowcat:
- When to use auto-detection vs explicit
- How to handle ambiguous cases
- Error message guidelines
- Help text best practices

## Expected Deliverables

### Research Document
- `analysis/cli-patterns-research.md` - Comprehensive analysis of CLI patterns
- Includes:
  - Successful patterns from other tools
  - Anti-patterns to avoid
  - Decision matrix for our use cases
  - Recommended approach for Shadowcat

### Design Guidelines
- Auto-detection heuristics
- Command naming recommendations
- Error handling patterns
- Help text templates

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] At least 5 tools analyzed
- [ ] Common patterns identified
- [ ] Anti-patterns documented
- [ ] Design principles extracted
- [ ] Recommendations documented
- [ ] Research document created

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | 
|------|--------|------------|
| Over-engineering auto-detection | HIGH | Keep heuristics simple |
| Copying without understanding | MEDIUM | Focus on principles, not implementation |
| Analysis paralysis | LOW | Time-box research |

## Duration Estimate

**Total: 2 hours**
- Tool analysis: 30 minutes
- Pattern identification: 45 minutes
- Principle extraction: 45 minutes

## Dependencies

None - can be done in parallel with A.0

## Integration Points

- **Design Proposal (A.2)**: Will use these findings
- **Implementation (B.2)**: Will implement these patterns
- **Help System (B.4)**: Will follow these guidelines

## Notes

- Focus on tools developers already know and love
- Consider both CLI veterans and newcomers
- Think about how this scales to future transport types

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Examples of CLIs to study

# ngrok - tunnel/proxy
ngrok http 8080
ngrok tcp 22

# docker - smart detection
docker run nginx
docker build .

# git - context aware
git status
git remote -v

# psql - connection
psql database_name
psql -h localhost -p 5432

# kubectl - resource oriented
kubectl get pods
kubectl proxy
```

## Example Patterns to Research

### Auto-detection Examples
```bash
# Git detects repository
git status  # Works if in repo, fails gracefully if not

# Docker detects Dockerfile
docker build .  # Finds Dockerfile automatically

# npm detects package.json
npm install  # Uses package.json in current dir
```

### Clear Verb Patterns
```bash
# Connection-oriented
psql connect database
ssh user@host
curl http://example.com

# Service-oriented  
nginx -s reload
redis-server
http-server .
```
