**✅ ALL PRIORITY REVERSE PROXY TASKS COMPLETE!**

The reverse proxy is now **production-ready** for deployment without authentication. Next phase should focus on:

#### **Phase 5B: Authentication & Security (Priority 1)**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Detailed task specifications exist for these components in `plans/tasks/reverse-proxy/` directory.
**Primary Plan**: `plans/022-phase5b-authentication-implementation-plan.md`
**Task Reconciliation**: `plans/tasks/reverse-proxy/000-task-status-reconciliation.md`

1. **OAuth 2.1 Implementation & JWT Validation**
   - **Task 003**: JWT Validation with JWKS (detailed specs available)
   - **Task 004**: AuthGateway Core Implementation (detailed specs available)
   - PKCE Support: Mandatory for security compliance
   - Performance Target: < 1ms JWT validation, < 5ms total auth overhead

2. **Policy Engine Integration** 
   - **Task 006**: Extended RuleBasedInterceptor with HTTP Conditions (detailed specs available)
   - Extend existing Phase 4 RuleBasedInterceptor for auth policies
   - Authorization rules based on token claims and HTTP context
   - Integration with interceptor chain and hot-reloading

3. **Rate Limiting, Audit Logging & Security**
   - **Task 007**: Rate Limiting and Audit Integration (detailed specs available)
   - **Task 008**: End-to-End Integration Testing (detailed specs available)
   - **Task 009**: Performance Testing and Optimization (detailed specs available)
   - Multi-tier rate limiting with tower-governor GCRA algorithm
   - Comprehensive audit logging for security events

#### **Phase 6: Production Deployment Features (Priority 2)**
4. **Load Balancing**
   - Multi-upstream support with health checks
   - Failover and circuit breaker patterns
   - Weighted routing algorithms

5. **Observability & Monitoring**
   - Enhanced metrics for production use
   - OTLP export for observability platforms
   - Dashboard templates and alerting rules

#### **Alternative: Phase 6 Direct (Skip Auth)**
If authentication is not immediately needed, proceed directly to Phase 6 (Observability) while reverse proxy serves as production API gateway without auth.

# Test with HTTP request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "MCP-Session-Id: test-123" \
  -H "MCP-Protocol-Version: 2025-11-05" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"1","method":"ping","params":{}}'

# Check health and metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
