## Remaining Phase 4 Tasks

### High Priority Tasks 🔴 REMAINING

#### 1. Dynamic Rule Loading & Hot-Reloading
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started  
**File:** `src/interceptor/rules_interceptor.rs` (enhancement)

**Estimated Effort:** 1.5 days

**Current State:**
- ✅ Basic rule loading from files implemented
- ✅ Runtime rule addition/removal working
- ❌ File system watching not implemented
- ❌ Automatic hot-reloading missing
- ❌ Rule validation before reload missing

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] **File System Watching** - Monitor rule files for changes using `notify` crate
- [ ] **Atomic Rule Reloading** - Replace rules without dropping active interceptions
- [ ] **Validation Before Reload** - Test new rules before applying to prevent service disruption
- [ ] **Rollback on Failure** - Revert to previous rules if new ones are invalid
- [ ] **Configuration Control** - Enable/disable auto-reload per interceptor instance
- [ ] **Change Notifications** - Log and optionally notify when rules are reloaded

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] File changes trigger automatic rule reloads within 1 second
- [ ] Invalid rule files don't crash or disable the interceptor
- [ ] Active message processing continues during rule reloads
- [ ] Rollback works correctly for malformed rule files
- [ ] Configuration option to enable/disable hot-reloading

#### 2. CLI Intercept Management
**Status:** 🔴 Not Started
