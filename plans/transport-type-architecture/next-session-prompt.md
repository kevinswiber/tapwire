# Next Session: Phase A - Deep Analysis

## Project Context

We need to refactor the transport type architecture in shadowcat to eliminate the `is_sse_session` code smell and create a unified, clean transport handling system across both forward and reverse proxies.

**Project**: Transport Type Architecture Refactor
**Tracker**: `plans/transport-type-architecture/transport-type-architecture-tracker.md`
**Status**: Phase A - Deep Analysis (0% Complete)

## Current Status

### What Has Been Completed
- **Initial Discovery** (✅ Completed 2025-08-16)
  - Identified `is_sse_session` as a code smell
  - Discovered duplicate transport architectures between proxies
  - Created comprehensive plan and tracker

### What's In Progress
- **Phase A: Deep Analysis** (Not Started)
  - Duration: 8-10 hours total
  - Dependencies: None

## Your Mission

Conduct thorough analysis of the current transport architecture to understand the full scope of changes needed before implementing any fixes. Since shadowcat is unreleased, we can make breaking changes freely.

### Priority 1: Transport Usage Audit (3 hours)

Complete **Task A.0** - Create comprehensive audit of transport type usage:
1. Map all `TransportType` enum usage locations
2. Document all `is_sse_session` checks and their purposes
3. Identify transport handling differences between proxies
4. Document findings in `analysis/transport-usage-audit.md`

### Priority 2: Parallel Analysis Tasks (4 hours)

If time permits, work on these in parallel:

**Task A.1** - Directional Transport Analysis (2h):
- Understand `IncomingTransport`/`OutgoingTransport` traits
- Analyze forward proxy usage patterns
- Identify gaps for reverse proxy adoption

**Task A.2** - Response Mode Investigation (2h):
- Understand what `is_sse_session` actually tracks
- Design proper `ResponseMode` enum
- Map response patterns (JSON, SSE, etc.)

## Essential Context Files to Read

1. **Primary Tracker**: `plans/transport-type-architecture/transport-type-architecture-tracker.md` - Full project context
2. **Task Details**: 
   - `plans/transport-type-architecture/tasks/A.0-transport-usage-audit.md`
   - `plans/transport-type-architecture/tasks/A.1-directional-transport-analysis.md`
   - `plans/transport-type-architecture/tasks/A.2-response-mode-investigation.md`
3. **Initial Analysis**: `plans/reverse-proxy-refactor/analysis/transport-type-architecture.md` - Discovery that led to this plan

## Working Directory

```bash
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat
```

## Commands to Run First

```bash
# Switch to the feature branch
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat
git checkout feat/transport-type-architecture

# Verify we're on the right branch
git branch --show-current

# Check current state
cargo check

# See scope of TransportType usage
rg "TransportType::" --type rust --stats

# See scope of is_sse_session usage  
rg "is_sse_session" --type rust --stats

# Check directional transports
ls -la src/transport/directional/
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup (15 min)
1. Read the tracker and task files
2. Set up analysis document structure
3. Prepare search commands

### Phase 2: Data Collection (2 hours)
1. Run comprehensive searches for transport usage
2. Document each usage location with context
3. Categorize by purpose (config, routing, session, etc.)

### Phase 3: Analysis (1.5 hours)
1. Identify patterns in usage
2. Map dependencies between components
3. Compare forward vs reverse proxy approaches

### Phase 4: Documentation (30 min)
1. Create comprehensive audit document
2. Include recommendations
3. Update tracker with findings

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] All TransportType usage documented
- [ ] All is_sse_session usage documented
- [ ] Transport architecture differences mapped
- [ ] Analysis documents created in `analysis/` directory
- [ ] Clear recommendations for next steps
- [ ] Tracker updated with progress

## Key Commands

```bash
# Find all transport type usage
rg "TransportType::" --type rust -A 2 -B 2

# Find session field usage
rg "is_sse_session|mark_as_sse" --type rust -A 3 -B 3

# Check directional transport usage
rg "IncomingTransport|OutgoingTransport" --type rust

# Find transport creation
rg "new.*Transport|create.*transport" --type rust -i
```

## Important Notes

- **Use `feat/transport-type-architecture` branch** - All changes go to this branch
- **No backward compatibility needed** - shadowcat is unreleased
- **Be thorough** - this analysis drives all subsequent work
- **Look for patterns** - identify common usage scenarios
- **Think architecturally** - consider ideal end state
- **Document everything** - future sessions depend on this analysis

## Key Design Considerations

1. **Bidirectional Nature**: Proxies have client→proxy and proxy→upstream transports
2. **Response Modes**: SSE vs JSON is about response format, not transport type
3. **Code Duplication**: Forward and reverse proxies duplicate transport logic

## Risk Factors & Blockers

- **Incomplete Analysis**: Take time to be thorough - rushing will cause problems later
- **Hidden Dependencies**: Look for implicit assumptions about transport behavior

## Next Steps After This Task

Once Phase A analysis is complete:
- **Task A.3**: Architecture Proposal (3 hours, depends on A.0, A.1, A.2)
- Then move to **Phase B**: Quick Fix Implementation

After Phase B:
- **Phase C**: Architectural Unification (larger refactor)

**Session Goal**: Complete comprehensive analysis of transport architecture to enable clean refactoring
