## Phase A Task Files (Complete)

### Completed Tasks ✅
- [A.0-transport-usage-audit.md](../tasks/A.0-transport-usage-audit.md)
- [A.1-directional-transport-analysis.md](../tasks/A.1-directional-transport-analysis.md)
- [A.2-response-mode-investigation.md](../tasks/A.2-response-mode-investigation.md)
- [A.3-architecture-proposal.md](../tasks/A.3-architecture-proposal.md)

### Phase B Tasks (To Be Created)

- B.3-test-validate.md - Needs creation

## Tracker Documents

### Main Tracker ✅
- **[transport-type-architecture-tracker.md](../transport-type-architecture-tracker.md)**
  - Status: Updated with Phase A completion
  - Shows all deliverables
  - Ready for Phase B

### Next Session Prompt ✅
- **[next-session-prompt.md](../next-session-prompt.md)**
  - Status: Updated for Phase B
  - Includes bitflags recommendation
  - Notes no compatibility needed

## Key Updates Based on Review

### Implemented Recommendations
1. ✅ Use bitflags for ClientCapabilities (not boolean struct)
2. ✅ Remove is_sse() compatibility completely
3. ✅ Keep current tokio::io implementation (already optimal)
4. ✅ Clarified ProxyCore vs UnifiedProxy naming
5. ✅ Added distributed storage considerations
6. ✅ Simplified ResponseMode enum (removed Unknown, Binary, WebSocket)
7. ✅ Use proper MIME parsing with mime crate
8. ✅ Consider Stream trait for async operations

### Documents Most Important for Implementation

**For Phase B Implementation:**
1. **implementation-roadmap.md** - Step-by-step guide
2. **implementation-recommendations.md** - Specific guidance
3. **next-session-prompt.md** - Ready-to-use session prompt

**For Understanding Design:**
1. **architecture-proposal.md** - Complete design
2. **design-decisions.md** - Rationale for choices
3. **distributed-storage-considerations.md** - Storage compatibility

## Checklist for Phase B Readiness

- [x] All Phase A tasks complete
- [x] Architecture proposal reviewed and refined
- [x] Implementation recommendations documented
- [x] Design decisions recorded
- [x] Distributed storage compatibility addressed
- [x] Next session prompt updated
- [x] Tracker shows Phase A complete
- [ ] Phase B task files created (optional - can be created during implementation)

## Summary

All essential analysis documents have been created and reviewed. The architecture is well-designed with:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper abstractions for distributed storage
- Type-safe capability tracking with bitflags
- Clean implementation without unnecessary compatibility
- Optimal use of existing tokio patterns

The project is ready to proceed to Phase B implementation with confidence.
