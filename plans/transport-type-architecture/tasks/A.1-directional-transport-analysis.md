# Task A.1: Directional Transport Analysis

## Objective

Analyze the existing `IncomingTransport` and `OutgoingTransport` trait architecture to understand how the forward proxy uses them and how the reverse proxy could benefit from adopting them.

## Background

The forward proxy already uses a clean directional transport architecture with:
- `IncomingTransport` trait for accepting connections
- `OutgoingTransport` trait for initiating connections
- Clear separation between client→proxy and proxy→server flows

The reverse proxy duplicates much of this logic. We need to understand the directional transport system to determine if/how to unify the approaches.

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What are the core responsibilities of IncomingTransport vs OutgoingTransport?
2. How does the forward proxy use these traits effectively?
3. What would it take to adapt the reverse proxy to use them?
4. Are there gaps in the current directional transport traits?
5. How do these traits handle different transport types (stdio, HTTP, SSE)?

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Trait Analysis Phase (30 min)

Understand the trait definitions and contracts:

```bash
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat

# Examine trait definitions
cat src/transport/directional/mod.rs

# Find all implementations
rg "impl.*IncomingTransport" --type rust -A 5
rg "impl.*OutgoingTransport" --type rust -A 5

# Look at the factory pattern
cat src/transport/directional/factory.rs
```

### 2. Forward Proxy Analysis (30 min)

Understand how forward proxy uses these traits:

```bash
# Examine forward proxy usage
cat src/proxy/forward.rs

# Look for transport creation
rg "Box<dyn IncomingTransport>" --type rust -B 2 -A 2
rg "Box<dyn OutgoingTransport>" --type rust -B 2 -A 2

# Check how transports are passed around
rg "client_transport|server_transport" src/proxy/forward.rs -A 2 -B 2
```

### 3. Reverse Proxy Gap Analysis (30 min)

Compare reverse proxy's approach:

```bash
# Look at reverse proxy transport handling
rg "TransportType::" src/proxy/reverse/ -B 2 -A 2

# Find direct subprocess spawning
rg "Command::new|spawn" src/proxy/reverse/ -B 2 -A 5

# Look for HTTP client usage
rg "reqwest|hyper" src/proxy/reverse/ -B 2 -A 2
```

### 4. Documentation Phase (30 min)

Document findings and recommendations.

- What needs to be done first

### Phase 2: Migration
- Step-by-step migration plan

### Phase 3: Cleanup
- Remove old code

## Risks and Mitigations

### Compatibility
- How to maintain backward compat

### Performance
- Impact on reverse proxy performance

### Complexity
- Managing the transition
```

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Complete understanding of IncomingTransport trait
- [ ] Complete understanding of OutgoingTransport trait
- [ ] All implementations documented
- [ ] Forward proxy usage patterns documented
- [ ] Reverse proxy gaps identified
- [ ] Unification strategy proposed
- [ ] Migration plan outlined
- [ ] Risks assessed and mitigated

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Traits missing needed functionality | HIGH | Extend traits carefully with backward compat |
| Performance regression in reverse proxy | MEDIUM | Benchmark before/after |
| Complex migration | MEDIUM | Phased approach with tests |

## Duration Estimate

**Total: 2 hours**
- Trait Analysis: 30 minutes
- Forward Proxy Analysis: 30 minutes
- Reverse Proxy Gap Analysis: 30 minutes
- Documentation: 30 minutes

## Dependencies

None - can be done in parallel with A.0

## Integration Points

- **Forward Proxy**: Current user of directional transports
- **Reverse Proxy**: Potential user of directional transports
- **Connection Pooling**: How it fits with directional model
- **Session Management**: How sessions interact with transports

## Notes

- Focus on understanding the abstraction boundaries
- Look for places where the traits might need extension
- Consider how SSE streaming fits into this model
- Think about connection pooling requirements
