# Task D.1: Document Architecture Decisions

**Duration**: 1 hour  
**Dependencies**: D.0 complete  
**Priority**: HIGH

## Objective

Document the architecture decisions made during the transport refactor, explaining why the forward and reverse proxies have different architectures and providing guidelines for future development.

## Key Questions

1. What are the fundamental differences between forward and reverse proxy requirements?
2. When should developers use directional transports vs direct implementations?
3. What lessons did we learn from the refactoring process?
4. How do we prevent future over-engineering?

## Process

### Step 1: Create Architecture Decision Record (20 min)

Create `docs/adr/001-transport-architecture.md`:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Transport Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
During the transport architecture refactor...

## Decision
We decided to keep forward and reverse proxy architectures separate because...

## Consequences
- Positive: Each proxy type can evolve independently
- Negative: Some code patterns are duplicated
- Neutral: Different complexity levels reflect different requirements
```

### Step 2: Update Developer Guide (20 min)

Update `docs/developer-guide.md` with:

1. **Transport Layer Overview**
   - When to use directional transports
   - When to use direct implementations
   - How to add new transport types

2. **Proxy Architecture Patterns**
   - Forward proxy: Simple pipeline pattern
   - Reverse proxy: Complex routing pattern
   - Why they're different

3. **Anti-patterns to Avoid**
   - Over-abstraction without clear benefit
   - Premature optimization (buffer pool example)
   - Forcing unification where differences are natural

### Step 3: Create Transport Implementation Guide (15 min)

Create `docs/transport-implementation-guide.md`:

```markdown
# Transport Implementation Guide

## When to Create a New Transport

### Use DirectionalTransport When:
- Clear separation between incoming/outgoing
- Need to support multiple transport types
- Want to leverage existing infrastructure (pooling, interceptors)

### Use Direct Implementation When:
- Transport has unique requirements
- Performance is critical
- Abstraction would obscure important details

## Examples
- StdioTransport: Uses traits ✅ (clear bidirectional flow)
- HyperHttpClient: Direct ✅ (needs fine control over streaming)
```

### Step 4: Document Lessons Learned (5 min)

Add to `plans/transport-type-architecture/analysis/lessons-learned.md`:

1. **Phase A**: Deep analysis was valuable
2. **Phase B**: Quick fixes work well for isolated issues
3. **Phase C**: Shared utilities can be over-engineering
4. **Phase D**: Not all architectures need unification

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Create documentation directories if needed
mkdir -p docs/adr

# Verify markdown rendering
markdown-preview docs/adr/001-transport-architecture.md

# Check for broken links
markdown-link-check docs/*.md
```

## Deliverables

1. **Architecture Decision Record**
   - `docs/adr/001-transport-architecture.md`
   - Clear rationale for current design
   - Guidelines for future changes

2. **Updated Developer Guide**
   - Transport layer section
   - Proxy architecture patterns
   - Anti-patterns section

3. **Transport Implementation Guide**
   - When to use each pattern
   - Concrete examples
   - Decision flowchart

4. **Lessons Learned Document**
   - Insights from each phase
   - What worked and what didn't
   - Recommendations for future refactors

## Success Criteria

- [ ] ADR clearly explains architecture decisions
- [ ] Developer guide helps new contributors understand the codebase
- [ ] Implementation guide prevents future over-engineering
- [ ] Lessons learned captures institutional knowledge
- [ ] Documentation is clear, concise, and actionable

## Notes

- Focus on practical guidance over theoretical perfection
- Use concrete examples from the refactor
- Be honest about trade-offs and compromises
- This documentation will save future developers time
