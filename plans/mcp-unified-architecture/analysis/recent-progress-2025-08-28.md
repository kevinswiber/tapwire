# Recent Progress Report - 2025-08-28

## Session Summary
Major progress on Streamable HTTP implementation and HTTP version negotiation.

## Completed Work

### 1. Streamable HTTP Implementation ‚úÖ

#### Server-side (streamable_incoming.rs)
- **Fixed SSE body streaming** (was TODO at line ~219)
  - Implemented proper `StreamBody` with async polling
  - Created `SseStream` that implements `Stream` trait
  - Properly formats SSE events with headers and data
  - Supports both JSON and SSE response modes based on Accept header

#### Client-side (streamable_outgoing.rs) 
- **Full implementation created from scratch**
  - Implements `Outgoing` trait for MCP protocol
  - Handles content negotiation (JSON vs SSE)
  - SSE event parsing with multiline support
  - Proper error handling throughout

### 2. HTTP Version Negotiation ‚úÖ

#### Connection Module (connection.rs)
- **Created `VersionedSender`** (renamed from `VersionedConnection` for clarity)
  - Tracks HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 for each connection
  - Unified interface for sending requests

#### Version Negotiation Logic
- **HTTPS connections**: 
  - ALPN negotiation implemented
  - Prefers HTTP/2, falls back to HTTP/1.1
  - Properly checks negotiated protocol
- **Plain HTTP**:
  - Default HTTP/1.1
  - Support for HTTP/2 prior knowledge
  - h2c upgrade probe (not fully implemented)

#### Connection Pooling Key (pool_key.rs)
- **Created `HttpPoolKey`**
  - Keys connections by `scheme://hostname:port` + HTTP version
  - Implements `PoolKey` trait for integration
  - Allows connection reuse for any path on same host
  - Properly normalizes URLs (strips path/query/fragment)

### 3. Code Quality ‚úÖ

#### Linting Fixes
- **Fixed all no_panic_in_prod warnings**
  - Added proper error handling where appropriate
  - Used `#[cfg_attr(dylint_lib = "shadowcat_lints", allow(no_panic_in_prod))]` for safe unwraps
  - HTTP Response::builder() calls documented as safe

### 4. Testing ‚úÖ
- Added comprehensive HTTP version negotiation tests
- Pool key normalization tests
- SSE event parsing tests
- All HTTP transport tests passing (36 tests)

## Architecture Decisions

1. **SSE works with both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2**
   - Corrected misconception that SSE requires HTTP/1.1
   - HTTP/2 actually better for SSE (multiplexing, HPACK compression)

2. **Naming clarity**: `VersionedSender` instead of `VersionedConnection`
   - Avoids confusion with many other "Connection" types

3. **Connection pooling by host + version**
   - Following curl's model for HTTP version negotiation
   - Proper connection reuse across different paths

## Current Status

### Sprint 2 Progress
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Session Store Trait | ‚úÖ | Already exists |
| SQLite Implementation | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Skipped - Redis later |
| Streamable HTTP Server | ‚úÖ | Complete with SSE |
| Streamable HTTP Client | ‚úÖ | Complete with parsing |
| SSE Session Tracking | üöß | Next priority |

### What's Still Needed

1. **SSE Session Tracking (Task 2.4)**
   - GET request handling for server-initiated streams
   - Session management integration with `Mcp-Session-Id`
   - Last-Event-Id support for resumability

2. **Connection Pool Integration**
   - Actually use the pool with `HttpPoolKey`
   - Currently connections are created directly
   - Need to integrate with existing pool module

## Code Locations

- `crates/mcp/src/transport/http/streamable_incoming.rs` - Server implementation
- `crates/mcp/src/transport/http/streamable_outgoing.rs` - Client implementation  
- `crates/mcp/src/transport/http/connection.rs` - Version negotiation
- `crates/mcp/src/transport/http/pool_key.rs` - Connection pooling key
- `crates/mcp/tests/http_version_negotiation.rs` - Integration tests

## Technical Notes

### HTTP Version Negotiation Flow
```
HTTPS:
1. TLS handshake with ALPN
2. Check negotiated protocol
3. Use HTTP/2 if "h2", HTTP/1.1 if "http/1.1"

Plain HTTP:
1. Check configuration (HttpMode)
2. If prior knowledge, use HTTP/2 directly
3. Otherwise HTTP/1.1 (optionally probe h2c upgrade)
```

### SSE Streaming Implementation
```rust
// Key innovation: async Stream trait implementation
struct SseStream {
    rx: mpsc::Receiver<SseEvent>,
}

impl Stream for SseStream {
    type Item = Result<Frame<Bytes>, hyper::Error>;
    
    fn poll_next(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Option<Self::Item>> {
        match ready!(self.rx.poll_recv(cx)) {
            Some(event) => {
                let data = Bytes::from(event.to_sse_string());
                Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(Frame::data(data))))
            }
            None => Poll::Ready(None),
        }
    }
}
```

## Metrics

- **Lines changed**: ~800+ lines
- **Files modified**: 8 core files
- **Tests added**: 10+ new tests
- **Lints fixed**: 16 no_panic_in_prod warnings

## Next Session Focus

1. Complete SSE Session Tracking (Task 2.4)
2. Integrate connection pool with HTTP transport
3. Sprint 2 completion and move to Sprint 3
