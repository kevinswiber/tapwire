# Stream Tracking Implementation - COMPLETED

## Date: 2025-08-29

## Summary
Successfully implemented full stream tracking with typed IDs for compile-time safety and proper MCP spec compliance.

## What We Actually Built

Instead of the originally planned implementation, we made a better architectural decision to use typed IDs throughout:

### 1. Created Typed ID System ✅
- **SessionId**: Wraps UUID for session identification
- **StreamId**: Wraps UUID for individual SSE stream tracking  
- **EventId**: Simple string wrapper (removed server-specific methods for clarity)

### 2. Refactored EventStore ✅
```rust
// Old API (session-only):
store_event(session_id: &str, event_id: String, data: Value)

// New API (session + stream):
store_event(session_id: &SessionId, stream_id: &StreamId, event_id: EventId, data: Value)
```

- Used `(SessionId, StreamId)` composite keys with DashMap for high-performance concurrent access
- Proper stream isolation for SSE replay per MCP spec
- No global locks - each stream can be accessed independently

### 3. Updated Session Infrastructure ✅
- Sessions now track their active streams
- SessionStore trait extended with stream management operations
- Memory store implementation updated with proper cleanup

### 4. Fixed Transport Layer ✅
- StreamableIncomingConnection now has a `stream_id` field
- SseEventTracker includes StreamId in its constructor
- Event tracking properly scoped to streams

### 5. Type Safety Benefits ✅
The typed approach prevents entire classes of bugs:
```rust
// IMPOSSIBLE now - won't compile:
get_events(stream_id, session_id)  // Wrong order!

// Must be:
get_events(&session_id, &stream_id)  // Correct types enforced
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Typed IDs over Strings**: Compile-time safety is worth the refactoring effort
2. **DashMap over nested HashMap**: Better concurrent performance
3. **EventId Simplification**: Removed `for_stream()`, `parse_stream_id()`, `parse_counter()` as they were server-specific and unused
4. **Clean API Break**: Better to fix it right than maintain backwards compatibility

## Test Coverage
- All 206 unit tests passing
- Examples updated and building
- Full compile with no warnings

## Files Modified

### Core Types
- `src/types.rs` - Added SessionId, StreamId, EventId types

### Event System  
- `src/events/store.rs` - Refactored for stream tracking
- `src/events/tracker.rs` - Updated imports
- `src/events/event_id.rs` - Updated for stream context

### Session Management
- `src/session/store.rs` - Extended trait for streams
- `src/session/memory.rs` - Implementation with stream support
- `src/session/manager.rs` - Added stream-aware methods
- `src/session/persistence_worker.rs` - Updated for typed IDs

### Transport Layer
- `src/transport/http/streamable_incoming.rs` - Added StreamId field
- `src/transport/http/streaming/event_tracker.rs` - Stream-aware tracking

### Tests & Examples
- All test files updated to use typed IDs
- Examples fixed with proper imports

## What We Didn't Need

The original plan had some complexity we avoided:
- No StreamManager needed (sessions handle their streams directly)
- No complex event ID parsing (EventId is opaque)
- No backwards compatibility layer (clean break was better)

## Next Steps

This completes Sprint 2.5 (Stream Tracking). The system now:
- ✅ Properly tracks individual SSE streams within sessions
- ✅ Supports correct Last-Event-ID replay per stream
- ✅ Has compile-time type safety throughout
- ✅ Follows MCP specification requirements

Ready to continue with Sprint 3: Advanced Features!
