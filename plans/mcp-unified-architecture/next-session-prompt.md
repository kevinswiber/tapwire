# Next Session Prompt - Streamable HTTP Implementation

## üéØ Current Focus: Streamable HTTP Transport - Sprint 2

**IMPORTANT**: Read the comprehensive knowledge base first:
```bash
cat /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/plans/mcp-unified-architecture/SSE-AND-STREAMING-KNOWLEDGE.md
```

## Context
We're implementing MCP's **Streamable HTTP** transport - a single transport that supports both:
- **HTTP-only mode**: Returns `application/json` for single responses
- **SSE mode**: Returns `text/event-stream` for streaming responses

## What We've Accomplished ‚úÖ

### Recent Session (2025-08-28)
‚úÖ **Fixed SSE body streaming** in `streamable_incoming.rs` (was TODO at line ~219)
  - Implemented proper `StreamBody` with async polling
  - Created `SseStream` that polls from channel
  - SSE events properly formatted and streamed

‚úÖ **Implemented HTTP version negotiation**
  - Created `VersionedSender` for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support
  - Proper ALPN negotiation for HTTPS (prefers HTTP/2)
  - HTTP/2 prior knowledge support for plain HTTP
  - Connection pooling key by `scheme://hostname:port` + version

‚úÖ **Created client-side implementation** (`streamable_outgoing.rs`)
  - Full `Outgoing` trait implementation
  - Handles both JSON and SSE response modes
  - SSE event parsing with multiline support
  - Integrated with new connection module

‚úÖ **Fixed all no_panic_in_prod lints**
  - Added proper error handling or cfg_attr allows

‚úÖ **Added comprehensive tests**
  - HTTP version negotiation tests
  - Pool key normalization tests
  - SSE event parsing tests

‚úÖ **Implemented SSE Event Replay** (Task 2.4 complete!)
  - Copied EventIdGenerator from shadowcat for thread-safe ID generation
  - Created EventStore trait and InMemoryEventStore implementation
  - Integrated event storage with Streamable HTTP responses
  - Implemented Last-Event-ID replay for SSE reconnection
  - Added tests for event replay functionality

### Previous Progress
‚úÖ Understood the Streamable HTTP specification  
‚úÖ Created `StreamableHttpConfig` for both stateful/stateless modes  
‚úÖ Documented all SSE knowledge and existing code  
‚úÖ Identified reusable components from shadowcat  

## Current Sprint 2 Status

Per `mcp-tracker-v2-critical-path.md`:

| ID | Task | Est | Status | Notes |
|----|------|-----|--------|-------|
| 2.0 | Session Store Trait | 6h | ‚úÖ | Already exists in store.rs |
| 2.1 | ~~SQLite Implementation~~ | ~~6h~~ | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Skipped - Redis later |
| 2.2 | Streamable HTTP Server | 8h | ‚úÖ | streamable_incoming.rs complete! |
| 2.3 | Streamable HTTP Client | 6h | ‚úÖ | streamable_outgoing.rs complete! |
| 2.4 | SSE Session Tracking | 6h | ‚úÖ | Event replay implemented! |

## What's Next üöÄ

### Sprint 2 Complete! üéâ
All tasks for Sprint 2 are done:
- ‚úÖ Session Store Trait exists
- ‚úÖ Streamable HTTP Server implemented
- ‚úÖ Streamable HTTP Client implemented  
- ‚úÖ SSE Session Tracking with event replay

### Next Sprint: Sprint 3 - Production Essentials
Per the tracker, Sprint 3 focuses on production readiness:
- Task 3.0: Interceptor Engine (8h) - Core extensibility
- Task 3.1: Error Handling Framework (6h) - Graceful degradation
- Task 3.2: Session Heartbeat (6h) - Liveness detection
- Task 3.3: Graceful Shutdown (6h) - Clean termination
- Task 3.4: Basic Integration Tests (6h) - Validation

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Connection Pool Integration** (leftover from Sprint 2)
   - Create HTTP connector that uses the connection pool
   - Ensure proper connection reuse by host+version
   
2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test complete SSE flow with reconnection
   - Verify event replay works end-to-end
   - Performance testing with multiple concurrent SSE streams

## Key Code Locations

```bash
# What we're working on
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-mcp-compliance/crates/mcp/src/transport/http/
ls streamable_*.rs  # Both server and client done!

# Session management to integrate
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-mcp-compliance/crates/mcp/src/session/
cat manager.rs  # Session tracking

# Event tracking for Last-Event-Id
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-mcp-compliance/crates/mcp/src/events/
cat tracker.rs  # Generic event tracking trait
```

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **HTTP Version Negotiation**
   - HTTPS: ALPN negotiation (HTTP/2 preferred)
   - HTTP: Default HTTP/1.1, optional HTTP/2 prior knowledge
   - SSE works with both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

2. **Connection Naming**
   - `VersionedSender` instead of `VersionedConnection` for clarity
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Error Handling**
   - Proper error propagation instead of unwrap()
   - Safe unwraps documented with cfg_attr

## Testing Status

```bash
# All passing!
cargo test -p mcp --lib transport::http  # 36 tests pass
cargo test -p mcp --test http_version_negotiation  # 3 pass, 2 ignored (need server)
```

## Sprint 2 Success Metrics

From tracker, we need:
- [x] Sessions persist across restarts (store trait exists)
- [x] SSE connections maintained (streamable HTTP working)
- [ ] Automatic SSE reconnection (need Last-Event-Id)
- [ ] Session cleanup working (need integration)

## Commands to Continue

```bash
# Navigate to working directory
cd /Users/kevin/src/tapwire/shadowcat-mcp-compliance/crates/mcp

# Review GET handler that needs implementation
grep -n "GET SSE not yet implemented" src/transport/http/streamable_incoming.rs

# Check session manager for integration points
cat src/session/manager.rs | grep -A5 -B5 "session_id"

# Run tests to ensure everything still works
cargo test --lib transport::http

# Check for any remaining TODOs
grep -r "TODO" src/transport/http/
```

## Remember
- We're in **Sprint 2** - focus on session persistence and SSE
- Quality over speed - we've made great progress!
- Think about WebSocket compatibility for future
- Document as you go
