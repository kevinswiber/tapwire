## Parallel Work Opportunities

### Can Run in Parallel:
- 1.0 + 1.1 (Different concerns)
- 2.2 + 2.3 (Server/Client SSE)
- 4.1/4.2 + 4.3 (Pool vs Redis)
- All Sprint 5 tests (after 5.0)

### Must Be Sequential:
- 1.0 → 1.2/1.3 (Fix before build)
- 1.4 → 2.0 → 2.1 (Store abstraction)
- 3.0 → 3.1 (Error handling needs interceptor)
- 4.1 → 4.2 (Design then implement)

## Session Planning Guide

### Optimal Session Groupings:

**Session 1** (8h): Sprint 1.0
- Fix all async antipatterns
- Run tests, verify improvements

**Session 2** (8h): Sprint 1.1 + start 1.2
- Set up observability (6h)
- Start hyper server work (2h)

**Session 3** (8h): Complete 1.2 + start 1.3
- Complete hyper server (4h)
- Start hyper client (4h)

**Session 4** (8h): Complete 1.3 + 1.5
- Complete hyper client (2h)
- Memory session store (4h)
- Integration testing (2h)

**Session 5** (8h): Sprint 1.4
- Full session manager implementation
- Testing with memory store

## Risk-Based Priority

### High Priority (Do First):
1. Async antipatterns - Foundation for everything
2. Observability - Need visibility immediately
3. Hyper integration - Core value proposition
4. Session management - Essential for proxy function
5. Error handling - Production stability

### Medium Priority (Core Features):
1. SSE support - Modern transport expected
2. SQLite persistence - Data durability
3. Interceptors - Extensibility needed
4. Integration tests - Quality assurance
5. Builder API - Developer experience

### Lower Priority (Can Defer):
1. WebSocket - Alternative transport
2. Redis - Advanced scaling
3. Connection pooling - Optimization
4. Chaos testing - Advanced validation
5. Soak testing - Long-term validation

## Key Improvements Over v1

1. **Task Sizing**: All tasks ≤8 hours (was up to 12h)
2. **Clear Priority**: Critical path marked with ⭐
3. **Incremental Value**: Each sprint delivers working software
4. **Flexible Planning**: Can stop after any sprint
5. **Parallel Work**: Identified what can run concurrently
6. **Risk-First**: High-risk items in Sprint 1
7. **Continuous Testing**: Tests throughout, not just at end
8. **Session-Optimized**: Clear groupings for Claude sessions

## Next Actions

1. Start with Sprint 1.0 (Fix Async Antipatterns)
2. Set up observability early (Sprint 1.1)
3. Focus on critical path items first
4. Defer non-critical features if needed
5. Test continuously as you build

## Notes

- Each sprint should have a working demo
- Metrics from Sprint 1 guide optimization
- Can pivot based on Sprint 1-2 learnings
- Redis and WebSocket are truly optional
- Documentation happens throughout, not just at end
