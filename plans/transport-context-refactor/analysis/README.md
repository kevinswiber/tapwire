# Transport Context Refactor - Analysis Documents

## Phase 0 Analysis Results

This directory contains the analysis outputs from Phase 0 of the Transport Context Refactor.

### Completed Analysis (Tasks A.0 & A.1)

#### Protocol Understanding
- **[mcp-protocol-layers.md](mcp-protocol-layers.md)** - MCP protocol layer analysis
  - Key finding: Notifications ARE bidirectional
  - Issue: Direction is implicit, not carried with messages
  
- **[architecture-clarification.md](architecture-clarification.md)** - Layer separation and ownership
  - Defines Transport, MCP, and JSON-RPC layer boundaries
  - Proposes MessageEnvelope structure

#### Codebase Analysis  
- **[transport-message-usage.md](transport-message-usage.md)** - Usage analysis across codebase
  - 34 files, 330 occurrences (not 90/658 as initially thought)
  - Session Manager is critical with 44 occurrences
  - No dead imports found
  
- **[current-workarounds.md](current-workarounds.md)** - Catalog of existing workarounds
  - 17 distinct workaround patterns documented
  - Shows the technical debt from missing context

#### Migration Planning
- **[migration-impact.md](migration-impact.md)** - Impact assessment and timeline
  - Total estimate: 60 hours (7.5 person-days)
  - Phased migration approach defined
  - Risk matrix and mitigation strategies

### Upcoming Deliverables (Tasks A.2, A.3, A.4)

These documents will be created in the next session:

- **message-envelope-design.md** - Concrete Rust type definitions (A.2)
- **migration-guide.md** - Step-by-step migration strategy (A.3)
- **breaking-changes.md** - Breaking changes documentation (A.4)

## Key Insights

1. **The core problem is confirmed**: Notifications lack direction information, breaking proxy routing
2. **The scope is manageable**: 34 files, not 90 as feared
3. **Session Manager is the lynchpin**: Must be migrated carefully
4. **Workarounds are pervasive**: 17 patterns show this refactor is overdue
5. **Performance impact acceptable**: <5% latency, ~28% memory per message
