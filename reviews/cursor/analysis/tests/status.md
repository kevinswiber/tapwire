# Phase A.2 â€” Build/Lint/Test Status Baseline

Short template per CURSOR_RUST_CODE_REVIEWER.md.

- Summary:
  - After rebasing onto `origin/main` (branch `cursor-review`), all checks are green.
  - fmt: clean
  - clippy: clean (no warnings with `-D warnings`)
  - tests: all green

- Critical Issues:
  - None.

- Observations:
  - Rebase details
    - Checked out tracking branch: `cursor-review` -> `origin/main` (commit `dd808af`).
  - Formatting
    - `cargo fmt --all --check`: passed.
  - Lints
    - Previous clippy error (manual strip in `mcp/event_id.rs`) resolved upstream; file has been removed/renamed and no longer present.
  - Tests
    - `cargo test`: passed across units and integration.

- Suggestions:
  - Keep `fmt` and `clippy -D warnings` in CI to preserve green baseline.

- Action Checklist:
  - None required; proceed to next review phases.
