# Shadowcat/Tapwire Code Review â€” Executive Summary and Wrap-up

## Executive Summary
- Security posture: Strong defaults and explicit header construction prevent client token leakage to upstreams. OAuth 2.1 basics are present (PKCE, state), and JWT validation enforces issuer/audience and algorithm allowlists with JWKS support.
- Performance: Hot-path reviews identified logging and allocation pressure; guidance recorded for recorder buffering and interceptor chain efficiency (targets maintained).
- API and correctness: Transport/session/proxy APIs are documented; error mapping guidance provided. No unsafe code detected; async cancellation and locking patterns reviewed with improvements suggested.
- Gaps and actions: Introduced plans for header allowlist guards, trusted proxy and Host/Origin validation, and a comprehensive security test plan to institutionalize guarantees.

## Key Outcomes
- Phase C API docs at v0.3 with cross-links and error taxonomy.
- Phase D performance analyses with delta citations: hot paths, recorder, interceptors.
- Phase E security analyses: tokens/header scrubbing, OAuth 2.1 and transport security.
- Phase F hardening plans: security tests, origin/trusted proxy design, header allowlist.

## High-priority Recommendations
- Implement header allowlist at reverse proxy boundaries (HTTP/SSE) with tests.
- Add trusted proxy configuration and Host/Origin validation; keep loopback default for dev and warn on 0.0.0.0.
- Land the security test suite to prevent regressions (HTTP/SSE upstream header assertions).

## Artifacts
- Analysis: see `reviews/cursor/analysis/**` (API, async, perf, security, tests)
- Session prompts and tracker: `reviews/cursor/NEW_SESSION_PROMPT_CURSOR.md`, `reviews/cursor/tracker.md`
- Implementation plan: `plans/security-hardening/**`

## Next Steps
- Convert plans under `plans/security-hardening/` into issues/PRs and implement in the Shadowcat repo following submodule workflow (see `CLAUDE.md`).
- Before merging changes, ensure `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test` are green and update docs accordingly.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to the team for maintaining strong separation at proxy boundaries and for clear transport abstractions that made review efficient. The proposed hardening will further lock in security guarantees and developer confidence.
