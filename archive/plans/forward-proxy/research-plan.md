# HTTP Forward Proxy Research Plan for Shadowcat

## Executive Summary

This research plan outlines the approach to extend Shadowcat's forward proxy capabilities to support HTTP-based MCP servers, including both standard HTTP request/response and Server-Sent Events (SSE) transports. Currently, Shadowcat only supports stdio-based MCP servers.

## Current State Analysis

### What Works
- **Stdio Transport**: Fully implemented with `StdioTransport` that spawns subprocesses
- **Forward Proxy Architecture**: Generic `ForwardProxy` that works with any `Transport` trait implementation
- **Session Management**: Complete session tracking and recording infrastructure
- **Interceptor Chain**: Flexible message interception and modification framework

### Gaps Identified
1. **HTTP Transport Limitations**:
   - Current `HttpTransport` only supports simple request/response
   - No SSE support for streaming responses
   - Missing bidirectional communication patterns

2. **CLI Limitations**:
   - `intercept` command only supports stdio servers
   - HTTP forward proxy command exists but is not implemented
   - No support for specifying transport type in intercept mode

3. **Protocol Version Support**:
   - Currently hardcoded to version `2025-11-05`
   - Need to support `2025-06-18` and potentially `2025-03-26`

## Research Objectives

### Phase 1: Protocol Understanding
1. **MCP HTTP Transport Variants**
   - Standard HTTP (request/response)
   - Streamable HTTP with SSE
   - Differences in message flow patterns

2. **Version Compatibility**
   - Differences between protocol versions
   - Header requirements per version
   - Backward compatibility strategies

### Phase 2: Technical Investigation
1. **SSE Implementation Strategy**
   - Rust libraries for SSE (e.g., `axum-sse`, `tokio-stream`)
   - Connection management for long-lived streams
   - Error recovery and reconnection

2. **Bidirectional Communication**
   - How to handle server-initiated requests over HTTP
   - Message correlation between requests and responses
   - Session state management

3. **Transport Abstraction Enhancement**
   - Extending `Transport` trait for streaming
   - Handling different message patterns (sync vs async)
   - Unified interface for stdio and HTTP variants

### Phase 3: Architecture Design
1. **Enhanced Transport Architecture**
   - `HttpTransport` vs `HttpSseTransport` vs unified approach
   - Connection pooling and reuse
   - Load balancing considerations

2. **Proxy Pattern Updates**
   - Handling asymmetric transports (stdio client â†’ HTTP server)
   - Message buffering for SSE streams
   - Timeout and keepalive strategies

3. **CLI Integration**
   - Transport selection in commands
   - Configuration for HTTP endpoints
   - Authentication and security
