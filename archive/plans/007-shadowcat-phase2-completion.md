## Completed Deliverables

### 1. ForwardProxy Implementation ✅
**File:** `src/proxy/forward.rs`  
**Tests:** 4 passing

**Key Features:**
- Bidirectional message routing between client and server transports
- Concurrent handling with separate reader/writer tasks for each direction
- Graceful shutdown with proper cleanup
- Integration with SessionManager and TapeRecorder
- Thread-safe design with Arc/RwLock patterns

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Uses tokio::spawn for concurrent message processing
- Channel-based communication between components
- Automatic session creation and recording initialization
- Clean error handling with context preservation

### 2. Session Management System ✅
**Files:** `src/session/manager.rs`, `src/session/store.rs`  
**Tests:** 14 passing

**Key Features:**
- Complete session lifecycle management (create, active, completed, failed, timeout)
- Frame recording and retrieval with timestamp tracking
- In-memory storage with HashMap-based implementation
- Session statistics and analytics
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions with configurable timeouts

**Data Structures:**
- `Session`: Metadata and status tracking
- `Frame`: Individual message with direction and timing
- `SessionManager`: High-level session operations
- `InMemorySessionStore`: Thread-safe storage backend

### 3. HTTP Transport Implementation ✅
**File:** `src/transport/http.rs`  
**Tests:** 7 passing

**Key Features:**
- Full Transport trait implementation for HTTP/HTTPS
- MCP protocol compliance with proper headers (MCP-Protocol-Version, Mcp-Session-Id)
- JSON-RPC message serialization and deserialization
- Request/response timeout handling
- Connection pooling with reqwest client
- HTTP server framework for incoming connections

**MCP Compliance:**
- Protocol version: `2025-11-05`
- Proper header handling for session tracking
- JSON-RPC 2.0 message format
- Error handling and status code management

### 4. Tape Recording Engine ✅
**File:** `src/recorder/tape.rs`  
**Tests:** 9 passing

**Key Features:**
- Session recording to persistent JSON "tapes"
- Frame buffering with configurable limits (default: 1000 frames)
- Rich metadata including timestamps, frame counts, and statistics
- File-based storage with atomic save operations
- Tape management operations (list, load, delete)
- Thread-safe concurrent recording

**Tape Format:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "session_id": "uuid", 
    "name": "string",
    "transport_type": "stdio|http|sse",
    "created_at": "timestamp",
    "duration_ms": "optional_number",
    "frame_count": "number",
    "total_bytes": "number",
    "tags": ["array"]
  },
  "frames": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "session_id": "uuid",
      "timestamp": "number",
      "direction": "ClientToServer|ServerToClient", 
      "message": "TransportMessage"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Complete Integration ✅
**Integration Points:**
- ForwardProxy automatically creates sessions via SessionManager
- ForwardProxy starts recording via TapeRecorder when both are configured
- All messages are recorded as frames with proper direction tracking
- Sessions are completed and recordings are stopped on proxy shutdown
- Clean error handling and logging throughout the integration

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Clean Architecture**: The modular design made integration seamless
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Writing tests first caught design issues early
3. **Async Patterns**: Tokio's async/await made concurrent programming manageable
4. **Error Handling**: Rich error types provided excellent debugging information

### Technical Challenges Overcome
1. **Ownership Issues**: Proper use of Arc/Clone for shared state across async tasks
2. **Transport Abstraction**: Generic design allowing seamless stdio/HTTP switching
3. **Recording Integration**: Non-intrusive recording that doesn't affect proxy performance
4. **Session Lifecycle**: Clean state management across async boundaries

### Performance Optimizations Applied
1. **Frame Buffering**: Reduces disk I/O for tape recording
2. **Concurrent Tasks**: Separate reader/writer tasks prevent blocking
3. **Connection Pooling**: HTTP client reuse for better performance
4. **Efficient Serialization**: JSON serialization with serde optimizations
